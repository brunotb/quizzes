          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Modern psychology is defined as the scientific study of both observable behavior and internal mental processes.",
          "long_explanation": "This comprehensive definition encompasses both external actions (behavior) and internal experiences like thoughts and feelings (mental processes). Option A reflects the narrower view of behaviorism. Option B describes the psychoanalytic approach specifically. Option D describes the neurobiological approach, which is only one part of the broader field."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Wundt's study found that it took longer to be consciously aware of perceiving a sound than to simply react to it.",
          "long_explanation": "This experiment demonstrated that mental processes are not instantaneous and that their duration can be measured, laying the groundwork for psychology as an experimental science. Participants in the 'conscious awareness' group were slower, disproving option A. Options C and D are directly contradicted by the study's findings and purpose."

          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The cognitive approach focuses on how thoughts and interpretations influence emotions and behaviors.",
          "long_explanation": "This scenario is a classic example of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which is rooted in the cognitive approach. The therapist is directly addressing the client's dysfunctional thoughts. A neurobiological approach would focus on brain chemistry, a psychoanalytic approach on unconscious conflicts, and a behaviorist approach on modifying observable behaviors through conditioning."

          "short_explanation": "The behaviorist approach focuses on modifying observable behavior through consequences like reinforcement and punishment.",
          "long_explanation": "This is an example of indirect (or negative) punishment, a core concept in operant conditioning, which is central to the behaviorist approach. The manager is shaping behavior (punctuality) by manipulating its environmental consequences. The other approaches are not concerned with this direct stimulus-response-consequence model."

          "short_explanation": "The biopsychosocial model explains behavior and mental processes through the interaction of biological, psychological, and social-cultural influences.",
          "long_explanation": "By examining factors from all three domains, the researcher is using the biopsychosocial model to gain a holistic understanding of the student's struggles. The other models are narrower, focusing on only one primary area of influence (unconscious conflicts, thought patterns, or learned behaviors)."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The core difference lies in their proposed cause of anxiety: biological processes versus unconscious psychological conflicts.",
          "long_explanation": "The neurobiological approach seeks causes in the physical body (e.g., neurotransmitter imbalances, genetic predispositions). In contrast, the psychoanalytic approach, developed by Freud, seeks causes in the mind's hidden depths, specifically unresolved conflicts and repressed memories from early life experiences."

          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Behaviorism redefined psychology as the study of observable behavior, rejecting the focus on unobservable mental life.",
          "long_explanation": "Influential behaviorists like John B. Watson argued that for psychology to be a true science, it must focus only on what can be directly seen and measured: behavior. This was a direct reaction against the introspection and focus on consciousness that characterized earlier psychological schools."

          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "A behaviorist would analyze the environmental triggers and consequences that maintain the observable behavior of avoidance.",
          "long_explanation": "The behaviorist perspective focuses on learned behaviors. In this case, the act of avoiding studying (the behavior) is likely maintained by negative reinforcement: it removes the unpleasant feeling of anxiety, making the avoidance behavior more likely to happen again. Option A is psychoanalytic, B is neurobiological, and C is cognitive."

          "options": {
            "A": "Fear is an innate, unlearned emotion.",
            "B": "Complex emotional responses like fear can be learned through classical conditioning.",
            "C": "Children are naturally afraid of white, furry objects.",
            "D": "Learned fears can be easily extinguished through simple exposure."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The study demonstrated that fear could be conditioned by pairing a neutral stimulus (a white rat) with a fear-inducing stimulus (a loud noise).",
          "long_explanation": "Little Albert was not initially afraid of the rat, showing fear is not always innate (A, C). The experiment successfully created a phobia, demonstrating that emotions can be learned associations. While fears can be extinguished, the study itself did not focus on this process (D)."

            "D": "Negative punishment"
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Negative reinforcement increases a behavior by removing an aversive (unpleasant) stimulus.",
          "long_explanation": "The desired behavior (submitting the report on time) is strengthened because it leads to the removal of an unpleasant stimulus (the manager's nagging). It is reinforcement because the behavior increases, and it is negative because a stimulus is being taken away. Positive punishment would involve adding an unpleasant stimulus, like extra work."

          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The nausea is a learned (conditioned) response to a previously neutral stimulus (the smell of seafood).",
          "long_explanation": "The original food poisoning was the Unconditioned Stimulus (US) that naturally caused nausea (UR). The smell of seafood was initially neutral but became associated with the US. Now, the smell alone is a Conditioned Stimulus (CS) that triggers the learned nausea, which is the Conditioned Response (CR)."

          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Stimulus generalization is the tendency for stimuli similar to the conditioned stimulus to elicit a similar response.",
          "long_explanation": "The dog is generalizing its learned response from the original bell (the CS) to a new, similar stimulus (the doorbell). Stimulus discrimination would be the opposite—the ability to tell the difference and only respond to the specific bell."

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Positive punishment decreases a behavior by adding an aversive (unpleasant) stimulus.",
          "long_explanation": "The goal is to decrease the interrupting behavior. This is achieved by adding an unpleasant consequence (the extra chore). It is 'positive' because a stimulus is being added, and 'punishment' because the goal is to reduce the frequency of the behavior."

            "B": "Classical conditioning applies only to animals, while operant conditioning applies to humans.",
            "C": "Classical conditioning involves learning associations between two stimuli, leading to involuntary responses, while operant conditioning involves learning associations between a voluntary behavior and its consequence.",
            "D": "Classical conditioning results in permanent learning, while operant conditioning is temporary."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The key distinction lies in the type of behavior (involuntary vs. voluntary) and the nature of the association (stimulus-stimulus vs. behavior-consequence).",
          "long_explanation": "Classical conditioning pairs two stimuli (e.g., bell and food) to produce an automatic, reflexive response (salivation). The learner is passive. Operant conditioning involves an active learner whose voluntary actions (e.g., pressing a lever) are strengthened or weakened by the consequences (e.g., receiving food)."

            "B": "Behaviors followed by favorable consequences become more likely, while behaviors followed by unfavorable consequences become less likely.",
            "C": "A neutral stimulus can elicit a response after being paired with a stimulus that naturally elicits that response.",
            "D": "Learning can only occur if the learner is consciously aware of the process."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The Law of Effect is the core principle that consequences shape voluntary behavior, forming the basis of operant conditioning.",
          "long_explanation": "Based on his experiments with cats in puzzle boxes, Thorndike concluded that satisfying outcomes 'stamp in' a behavior, making it more probable in the future. This principle was later elaborated upon by B.F. Skinner. Option C describes classical conditioning, and Option A describes observational learning."

          "long_explanation": "The green light signals to the dolphin that the conditions are right for its jumping behavior to be rewarded with a fish. It helps the dolphin 'discriminate' between when to perform the action and when not to. This is a key concept in Skinner's experiments on operant conditioning."

          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The study showed that vicarious punishment decreases the likelihood that an observer will imitate a model's behavior.",
          "long_explanation": "While all children in the experiment learned the aggressive behavior, those who saw the adult model being punished were significantly less likely to perform the actions themselves. This demonstrates that the observed consequences for the model are a critical factor in the 'Performance' phase of observational learning, influencing the observer's motivation."

          "short_explanation": "A variable-ratio schedule provides reinforcement after a random and unpredictable number of responses.",
          "long_explanation": "The player never knows which pull of the lever will be the winning one, which encourages a high and steady rate of responding. This makes the variable-ratio schedule extremely effective and highly resistant to extinction, which is why it is so commonly used in gambling."

          "long_explanation": "The acquisition phase consists of two steps: observation (attention) and memorization (retention). The intern is actively watching and trying to remember, which are the core activities of this initial phase. The performance phase, which includes reproduction and motivation, would occur later when she attempts to perform the procedure herself."

          "short_explanation": "Continuous reinforcement is fast for learning but weak against extinction, while partial reinforcement is slow for learning but strong against extinction.",
          "long_explanation": "When a behavior is reinforced every single time (continuous), learning is rapid, but the behavior stops quickly once the reinforcement is removed. When a behavior is reinforced only sometimes (partial), it takes longer to learn, but the learner persists for a much longer time when reinforcement stops because they are used to not being rewarded every time."

          "long_explanation": "Strict behaviorism focuses only on observable behaviors and their direct consequences. Bandura's theory was revolutionary because it argued that learning could occur without direct reinforcement and depended on cognitive steps like paying attention, forming a mental representation (memory), and motivation. This incorporation of mental states connected the behavioral and cognitive schools of thought."

          "long_explanation": "For an individual to learn and perform a behavior through observation, they must first pay attention to the model, then retain what they observed in memory. Next, they must be physically and mentally able to reproduce the behavior. Finally, they must be motivated to perform it, often based on the observed consequences."

          "long_explanation": "The Alarm phase is the initial fight-or-flight reaction. The Resistance phase is a period of adaptation where the body tries to cope with the ongoing stressor. If the stressor persists, the body's resources become depleted, leading to the Exhaustion phase, where vulnerability to illness increases."

          "short_explanation": "Only a true experiment, with manipulation of the independent variable and random assignment, can establish causality.",
          "long_explanation": "To prove causation, the researchers must randomly assign participants to either the new tutorial (treatment group) or the old tutorial (control group) and then measure the difference in their learning speed. This process rules out alternative explanations, allowing for a causal conclusion. Correlational designs like cross-sectional or longitudinal studies can only show relationships, not cause-and-effect."

          "long_explanation": "Both designs may involve manipulating an independent variable and using a control group. However, the lack of random assignment in a quasi-experiment means the groups may not be comparable at the start, which introduces potential confounding variables and makes it much more difficult to draw causal conclusions."

          "long_explanation": "A cross-sectional study measures variables at the same time, so you don't know if X caused Y or Y caused X (directionality problem). Furthermore, an unmeasured third variable, Z, could be causing both X and Y (third-variable problem). Without the manipulation and control provided by an experiment, these alternative explanations cannot be excluded."
