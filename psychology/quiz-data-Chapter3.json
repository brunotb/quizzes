          "question": "A team manager stops nagging an employee about their messy desk after the employee begins tidying it up every Friday. As a result, the employee continues to tidy their desk regularly. This is a clear example of:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Positive reinforcement, because a desirable behavior was established.",
            "B": "Negative reinforcement, because an aversive stimulus was removed to increase a behavior.",
            "C": "Direct punishment, because nagging is an unpleasant consequence.",
            "D": "Indirect punishment, because the manager's attention was withdrawn."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The removal of the unpleasant nagging (a negative thing) reinforces the tidying behavior.",
          "long_explanation": "This is a classic example of negative reinforcement. The key is that a behavior (tidying the desk) is strengthened because it leads to the removal of an aversive or unpleasant stimulus (the manager's nagging). It is not punishment, as the goal is to increase, not decrease, the behavior. It is not positive reinforcement because nothing pleasant was added."

          "question": "According to Baddeley and Hitch's working memory model, which component is primarily responsible for mentally rotating a complex 3D shape to see if it matches another shape?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The Phonological Loop",
            "B": "The Central Executive",

            "D": "The Episodic Buffer"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The Visual-Spatial Notepad (or sketchpad) is specialized for handling visual and spatial information.",
          "long_explanation": "While the Central Executive directs the overall task, the actual manipulation and temporary storage of the visual and spatial information of the 3D shape occurs in the Visual-Spatial Notepad. The Phonological Loop deals with auditory information, and the Episodic Buffer integrates information into a coherent event, but the core task of mental rotation is a function of the visual-spatial system."

          "id": 3,
          "question": "A child observes a sibling being scolded for drawing on the walls. Later, when given crayons, the child avoids drawing on the walls. According to Bandura's theory of model learning, this outcome is best explained by:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Vicarious reinforcement",
            "B": "Direct punishment",
            "C": "Acquisition without performance",
            "D": "Vicarious punishment"
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The child learned to avoid the behavior by observing their sibling being punished for it.",
          "long_explanation": "This scenario illustrates vicarious punishment. The child learns the negative consequences of a behavior without having to experience the punishment directly. They observed the model (the sibling) being punished, which in turn suppressed the likelihood of them performing the same behavior. Vicarious reinforcement is the opposite, where observing a reward increases behavior."

          "id": 4,
          "question": "A person enjoys fishing at a lake where they catch a fish on average once every 45 minutes, but the exact time is unpredictable. This pattern of catching fish represents which reinforcement schedule?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Variable-interval",
            "B": "Fixed-interval",

            "D": "Fixed-ratio"
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "The reward (catching a fish) is based on an unpredictable amount of time passing.",
          "long_explanation": "This is a variable-interval schedule because the reinforcement (the catch) is contingent on the passage of an unpredictable, varying amount of time. It is not ratio-based because the number of casts (responses) does not guarantee a fish. It is not a fixed schedule because the time between catches is not constant. This type of schedule produces slow, steady responding."

          "id": 5,
          "question": "A project manager starts a new project by creating a detailed list of specific, measurable, attractive, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) goals. According to the model of self-regulated learning, this action is primarily an example of which strategy?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A metacognitive strategy (Planning)",
            "B": "A cognitive strategy (Organisation)",

            "D": "A cognitive strategy (Elaboration)"
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Setting goals is a key part of the 'Planning' phase, which is a metacognitive (thinking about thinking) strategy.",
          "long_explanation": "Setting SMART goals is a classic example of the metacognitive strategy of Planning. Metacognition involves higher-order thinking about the learning process itself—planning, monitoring, and evaluating. While organizing tasks is cognitive, the act of setting overarching goals to guide the entire process falls under the umbrella of metacognitive planning."

          "id": 6,
          "question": "An experiment shows that participants remember a list of 20 animals and minerals far better when they are grouped into categories (e.g., mammals, birds, precious metals, stones) than when presented in a random order. This demonstrates the memory-enhancing effect of:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Mnemonics",
            "B": "Chunking",

            "D": "The phonological loop"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Organizing information from broad categories to specific examples is the definition of using hierarchies.",
          "long_explanation": "This is a direct application of hierarchical organization. By structuring the information into a hierarchy (Animals -> Mammals/Birds; Minerals -> Metals/Stones), learners create a logical framework that significantly improves encoding and retrieval. While chunking involves grouping items, hierarchies imply a multi-level structure of broad concepts and specific details, which is what is described here."

          "id": 7,
          "question": "According to psychological principles discussed in the lecture, which approach to punishment is generally most effective in changing behavior in the long term?",
          "options": {
            "A": "A severe penalty that is delivered with a significant delay.",
            "B": "An unpredictable punishment that varies in intensity.",
            "C": "A very severe penalty that is applied only for major infractions.",
            "D": "A swift and targeted penalty that is applied consistently."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "For punishment to be effective, it should be immediate, consistent, and not necessarily severe.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture emphasizes that swift and targeted punishment is more effective than severe penalties. The key to effective punishment is the immediacy and certainty of the consequence, which creates a clear association between the behavior and the negative outcome. Delayed or overly severe punishment is often less effective and can lead to unwanted side effects like fear and aggression."

          "id": 8,
          "question": "A junior surgeon has watched hundreds of hours of a complex surgical procedure and can perfectly describe every step. However, when they first attempt the procedure, they are clumsy and unable to perform it correctly. In the context of the four phases of model learning, where is the primary breakdown occurring?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Observation",
            "B": "Reproduction",
            "C": "Memorisation",
            "D": "Motivation"
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The surgeon has observed and memorized the steps but lacks the physical capability to reproduce the action.",
          "long_explanation": "The surgeon has successfully completed the Observation and Memorisation phases. The breakdown is in the Reproduction phase, which involves having the physical and cognitive ability to imitate the observed behavior. Knowing the steps intellectually is different from having the motor skills and practice to execute them. Motivation is likely high, so that is not the issue."

        {
          "id": 9,
          "question": "In the Atkinson-Shiffrin multi-store model of memory, what is the critical process that determines whether information moves from sensory memory to short-term memory?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Attention",
            "B": "Rehearsal",
            "C": "Chunking",
            "D": "Retrieval"
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Attention acts as the gatekeeper, selecting which sensory information is important enough to be processed further.",
          "long_explanation": "According to the model, we are bombarded with sensory information. Attention is the selective filter that determines which tiny fraction of this information is transferred from the fleeting sensory memory buffer into our conscious awareness (short-term memory). Rehearsal is what keeps information *in* short-term memory, but attention is what gets it there in the first place."

        {
          "id": 10,
          "question": "A vending machine that has always worked perfectly (continuous reinforcement) suddenly breaks. Another machine has always been faulty, only working sometimes (partial reinforcement). If both stop working completely, which pattern of behavior would be expected?",
          "options": {
            "A": "People will give up on both machines at the same rate.",
            "B": "People will give up on the faulty machine faster.",
            "C": "People will give up on the perfect machine faster.",
            "D": "People will try the perfect machine more times before giving up."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Behaviors learned through continuous reinforcement are extinguished more quickly (fast deletion) when reinforcement stops.",
          "long_explanation": "This illustrates the principle of resistance to extinction. With the perfect machine (continuous reinforcement), the expectation is 100% reward. When that rule is broken, the behavior is quickly extinguished. With the faulty machine (partial reinforcement), the user is already accustomed to not being rewarded every time, so they will persist much longer, thinking the next try might work. This is called slow deletion."

        {
          "id": 11,
          "question": "A student is learning about operant conditioning. Instead of just memorizing the definitions, they try to think of personal examples for each concept (e.g., 'My parents used positive reinforcement when they gave me dessert for finishing my vegetables'). Which specific cognitive learning strategy are they using?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Repetition",
            "B": "Elaboration",
            "C": "Organisation",
            "D": "Regulation"
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Elaboration involves connecting new information to existing personal knowledge and experiences.",
          "long_explanation": "This is a prime example of elaboration. The student is not merely repeating or organizing the information; they are actively integrating the new concepts into their pre-existing knowledge base (their own life experiences). This process of making information personally meaningful creates stronger memory traces and is a much deeper form of processing than simple repetition."

          "question": "A professor wants to measure students' memory of historical figures. One test asks students to 'List all the inventors from the 19th century you can think of.' Another test gives them a list of 50 names and asks them to 'Circle all the inventors.' The first test measures ________, while the second measures ________.",
          "options": {
            "A": "Recognition; Relearning",
            "B": "Recall; Relearning",
            "C": "Recognition; Recall",
            "D": "Recall; Recognition"
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The first test is free recall (no cues), while the second is recognition (identifying from a list).",
          "long_explanation": "The first task, which requires students to reproduce information from memory without cues, is a measure of recall. The second task, which only requires them to identify previously learned information from a set of options, is a measure of recognition. Recognition is a less demanding memory task than recall, as the retrieval cues are provided."

          "id": 13,
          "question": "What is the most fundamental difference between classical conditioning and operant conditioning?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Classical conditioning involves involuntary responses, while operant conditioning involves voluntary behaviors.",
            "B": "Operant conditioning uses reinforcement, while classical conditioning uses punishment.",
            "C": "Classical conditioning is about learning from consequences, while operant conditioning is about associations.",
            "D": "Operant conditioning applies only to animals, while classical conditioning applies to humans."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Classical conditioning links automatic, involuntary responses (like salivating) to new stimuli, whereas operant conditioning shapes voluntary choices based on consequences.",
          "long_explanation": "The core distinction lies in the nature of the behavior being conditioned. Classical conditioning deals with associating a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit an involuntary, automatic response (e.g., Pavlov's dogs salivating). Operant conditioning deals with how the consequences of a voluntary, chosen behavior (e.g., pressing a lever) influence the likelihood of that behavior being repeated."

          "options": {
            "A": "Uses mnemonics to create a vivid image.",

            "D": "Relies on procedural knowledge to automate the process."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Chunking organizes many individual items into a smaller number of meaningful units, overcoming the limits of short-term memory.",
          "long_explanation": "This is a classic example of chunking. Instead of trying to hold 12 individual digits in short-term memory (which exceeds the typical capacity of 7 +/- 2), the person groups them into 5 manageable chunks. This reduces the cognitive load and makes the information easier to rehearse and transfer to long-term memory."

          "id": 15,
          "question": "After a project fails, a team leader facilitates a discussion focused on 'What could we, as a team, have done differently?' rather than blaming external factors. This is an example of fostering which motivational-affective learning strategy?",

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Attribution is about reflecting on the causes of successes and failures to learn from them.",
          "long_explanation": "This scenario directly relates to the concept of attribution. By encouraging the team to reflect on internal, controllable reasons for failure, the leader is promoting a healthy attributional style. This helps the team learn from their mistakes and feel a sense of agency, rather than helplessness. It is a key strategy for building resilience and improving future performance."

          "id": 16,
          "question": "Which of the following best explains why reinforcement by quota (ratio) is generally more effective at motivating high rates of behavior than reinforcement by interval?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Interval schedules are too predictable and lead to boredom.",
            "B": "Quota schedules are easier for a person to understand.",
            "C": "Interval schedules provide reinforcement even when no behavior occurs.",
            "D": "Quota schedules create a direct link between effort and reward."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "With quota/ratio schedules, the learner's own actions directly determine when they get a reward, giving them more control.",
          "long_explanation": "Reinforcement by quota (e.g., getting paid per item produced) is more effective because it establishes a clear and direct contingency between the individual's rate of response and the delivery of the reward. More work equals more reward. With interval schedules (e.g., a weekly salary), the reward is tied to the passage of time, not the amount of effort exerted within that time, which can lead to lower and less consistent rates of behavior."

          "options": {
            "A": "Information in long-term memory decays within minutes.",
            "B": "Information in short-term memory is lost rapidly without rehearsal.",
            "C": "Chunking is an ineffective strategy for remembering letters.",
            "D": "The capacity of short-term memory is about three elements."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The experiment showed that when rehearsal is prevented, information in STM fades in as little as 3-18 seconds.",
          "long_explanation": "The crucial finding of the Peterson & Peterson study was the rapid decay of information from short-term memory when rehearsal is blocked. The distracting task of counting backward prevented participants from repeating the letters to themselves, leading to a dramatic drop in recall over a very short period. This highlighted the importance of active maintenance rehearsal for holding information in STM."

          "short_explanation": "The programmer learned by observing the negative consequences experienced by a 'model' (their colleague).",
          "long_explanation": "This is a clear case of model learning, specifically involving vicarious punishment. The programmer did not need to be personally punished (operant conditioning) to learn the rule. They learned the contingency by observing the negative outcome for their colleague. This observational learning is a powerful and efficient way that social and professional norms are transmitted."

This type of memory is often implicit and non-verbal; we can perform the action without being able to consciously articulate all the steps involved.

It is the attentional controller that manages the two 'slave systems'—the Phonological Loop (processing the lecture audio) and the Visual-Spatial Notepad (creating the mental sketch).
