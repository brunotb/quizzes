            "A": "To provide a simple list of all publications in a field.",
            "B": "To find a promising research gap by critically approaching the literature.",
            "C": "To prove that the researcher's initial hypothesis is correct.",
            "D": "To only summarize the most famous studies without critique."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "A literature review's main goal is to critically analyze existing work to identify a research gap.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 2 emphasizes that you cannot craft a good research question until you find a promising research gap, which requires you to stop trusting the literature and approach it more critically. The process is not about simple summarization but about systematic and critical analysis to justify new research."

          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "A Narrative Review is the traditional, less structured approach to reviewing literature.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 13 defines a narrative review as a traditional approach that is less systematic and can be prone to bias. In contrast, a systematic review is highly structured, a meta-analysis is statistical, and a scoping review maps broad topics."

          "short_explanation": "A Systematic Review is defined by its highly structured and rigorous methodology designed to be comprehensive and minimize bias.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 14 highlights that a systematic review uses a rigorous and reproducible methodology. It is distinct from a meta-analysis which is quantitative, a hermeneutic review which is interpretive, and a narrative review which is a broad overview."

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "A knowledge void gap occurs when knowledge is missing in a field or when study results are unexpected.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 40 defines a knowledge gap (specifically a knowledge void gap) as a situation where knowledge may not exist in the field or the results of a study differ from expectations. Contradictory findings refer to an evidence gap, and under-represented populations refer to a population gap."

          "short_explanation": "The TUM-SGwP defines academic misconduct as practicing gross negligence, which can be either intentional or unintentional.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 23 states, 'The code of good scientific practice is in violation when someone practices gross negligence (whether intentional or unintentional) in any of the following ways...' This indicates that the severity of the act (gross negligence) is key, not just minor errors."

          "short_explanation": "The right to citation requires a clear, content-related purpose and connection between the cited work and your own.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 32 explicitly states, 'The citations must have a purpose. This means, there has to be a content-related connection between your work and the cited work.' It also specifies that citation for mere illustration or ornament is not permitted."

          "short_explanation": "Retrievability means your citation must enable the reader to locate the source you used.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 34 defines the principle of Retrievability with the questions: 'Where does my information come from? Can my reader find my sources?' This highlights the importance of providing a clear path back to the original work for verification and further reading."

          "short_explanation": "'Code is Law' argues that the architecture of cyberspace and software acts as a form of regulation on user behavior.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 6 presents 'Code is Law' as a key concept demonstrating that technology is not neutral. It explains that constraints and freedoms built into the code (architecture) of a system function like laws, norms, and market forces to regulate what is possible for a user to do."

          "long_explanation": "Slide 12 explains that a 'risk society' is a 'systematic way of dealing with hazards and insecurities induced and introduced by modernisation itself.' It highlights that these risks are manufactured (e.g., from genetic engineering), invisible, and unequally distributed, and cannot be overcome by the existing industrial system."

          "long_explanation": "Slides 18, 19, and 24 clarify that a DPIA is a rights-based risk assessment focused on data protection and privacy risks. Its goal is to provide assurance that controllers adequately address these specific risks to data subjects. This is narrower than an FRIA, which covers a broader range of fundamental rights."

          "long_explanation": "Slide 24 explains the regulatory synergy between the two. A DPIA covers data protection and privacy risks, while a FRIA covers a broader range of fundamental rights concerns. The AI Act allows for a DPIA to be used as a foundation, which the FRIA then complements by addressing the additional rights."

          "long_explanation": "Slide 18 shows the 'Test' stage as the final part of the initial cycle. Its purpose is to solicit feedback on the prototypes created in the previous stage. This feedback can be used to refine the solution or even to better understand the user, leading back to the 'Empathize' or 'Ideate' stages in a non-linear fashion."

Key properties include having no definitive formula, no stopping rule, being essentially unique, and every solution being a 'one-shot operation.' This contrasts sharply with 'tame' problems that have clear, testable solutions."

          "long_explanation": "Slide 12, 'Pluralism in design thinking,' shows that 'Design Thinking' is at the center of four different interpretations: Spirit or Culture (organizational), Imaginative Act (creative), Cognitive Processes (mental), and Creative Inquiry (methodological). This demonstrates its multifaceted nature."

It is the aspect of design that allows a user to perceive what actions they can take with an object or interface. It is a prerequisite for the second principle, 'Understanding'."
