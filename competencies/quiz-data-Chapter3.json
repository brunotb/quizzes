          "question": "According to the DFG Standards Framework, which of the following categories primarily addresses the 'what if' scenarios of academic work, such as handling allegations of rule-breaking?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Principles",
            "B": "Research Process",
            "C": "Non-compliance with Good Research Practice, Procedures",
            "D": "Professional Ethics"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The 'Non-compliance' section deals with procedures for when things go wrong, like misconduct allegations.",
          "long_explanation": "The DFG Standards Framework is structured into three parts: 'Principles' (the 'why,' including professional ethics), 'Research Process' (the 'how,' covering daily practices like design and documentation), and 'Non-compliance with Good Research Practice, Procedures' (the 'what if'). This third pillar, which includes Guideline 19, specifically outlines the procedures for handling alleged research misconduct, making it the correct answer for 'what if' scenarios."

          "question": "A student submits a paper with a comprehensive bibliography. However, an examiner notes that several sources listed in the bibliography are not cited anywhere in the main text. This form of misconduct is best described as:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Pawn Sacrifice",
            "B": "Bibliography Balloon",
            "C": "Bibliography Amnesia",

          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Bibliography Balloon refers to padding the reference list with sources that were not actually cited in the text.",
          "long_explanation": "This is a classic example of 'Bibliography Balloon,' where the reference list is artificially inflated to give the impression of more thorough research. It differs from 'Bibliography Amnesia,' which is forgetting to list a cited source, and 'Pawn Sacrifice,' which involves misusing a legitimately cited source to cover for other plagiarism from that same source. 'Clause Splicing' relates to the construction of text, not the bibliography."

          "id": 3,
          "question": "Under § 22 of the TUM APSO, the use of Generative AI tools in an exam where they are not explicitly permitted is considered academic misconduct primarily because they fall under the category of:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Fraud and deceit",
            "B": "Falsification of data",

          "short_explanation": "Generative AI is classified as an 'unauthorized resource' unless specifically allowed by the instructor.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 6 explicitly links 'Generative AI tools' to the phrase 'unauthorized materials or resources' from § 22 of the TUM APSO. While using AI could be seen as a form of deceit (A), the most precise classification according to the lecture is that it's an unapproved resource. It is not about falsifying data (B) or necessarily violating copyright (C) in this context."

          "short_explanation": "Zitatrecht requires a clear purpose (like critique), proper identification (quotes), limited scope, and a full reference.",
          "long_explanation": "Option A meets all key conditions: there is a purpose (critique), identification (quotation marks), and a reference. Option B fails because Zitatrecht applies to direct quotations, not paraphrasing. Option C fails because the purpose cannot be merely decorative. Option D fails the 'as much as necessary but as little as possible' rule; quoting a whole chapter is excessive."

            "A": "The TUM-SGwP is an older statute that the DFG Code of Conduct replaced.",
            "B": "TUM adopted its statute to implement the principles of the DFG Code at the university level.",
            "C": "The two documents are unrelated and govern different types of research activities.",

          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "TUM's statute is the local implementation of the national DFG guidelines.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 20 explicitly states that 'TUM adopted a statute for safeguarding good scientific practices corresponding to the Code of Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).' This shows that the TUM-SGwP is the university's way of operationalizing the national standards set by the DFG. Both are considered binding ethical frameworks within their respective domains."

          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Authorship is for intellectual contributions, while acknowledgements are for technical or financial support.",
          "long_explanation": "DFG Guideline 14 states, 'An author is an individual who has made a genuine, identifiable contribution to the content.' This intellectual input is the deciding factor. Providing funding or equipment (C), being a lab head without intellectual input (D), or simply spending time on the project (B) are typically grounds for an acknowledgement, not authorship."

          "options": {
            "A": "A raw dataset of temperature readings from a weather station.",

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "A unique visualization requires creative choices and is therefore protected, unlike raw data or official texts.",
          "long_explanation": "Schöpfungshöhe requires a work to be an intellectual creation. Raw data (A), official works like laws (B), and simple functional lists like a table of contents (D) typically lack the necessary creativity. A uniquely designed chart (C), however, involves creative choices in color, layout, and representation, thus meeting the threshold for copyright protection."

          "options": {
            "A": "Only professors and academic staff at TUM.",
            "B": "Only the person whose work was directly affected by the misconduct.",

          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Access to the Ombudsperson is open to anyone with a concern, including the potentially accused.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 26 states that access is 'Open to anyone reporting suspected academic misconduct' and explicitly 'Includes individuals concerned they may be suspected.' This broad access ensures that all parties have a channel to address issues of scientific integrity in a structured and confidential manner."

            "A": "Strictly following all legal statutes related to research.",
            "B": "Working according to the established rules and standards of the specific scientific field.",

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "'Lege artis' means 'according to the rules of the art,' referring to the standards of one's specific discipline.",
          "long_explanation": "As explained on Slide 8, 'lege artis' translates to 'according to the rules of the art.' In a scientific context, this means adhering to the state-of-the-art methods, standards, and ethical norms recognized within one's particular field of research. It is broader than just legal statutes (A) and is about rigor, not just creativity (C). It explicitly contradicts the idea of selective reporting (D)."

          "short_explanation": "Retrievability is about ensuring that a reader can locate the original source based on the citation provided.",
          "long_explanation": "The 4 Principles of Citing each address a different question. 'Can my reader find my sources?' is the core question of Retrievability (Slide 34). Usability asks 'May I cite this source?'. Authorship asks 'Which ideas are mine?'. Consistency asks 'Did I apply my chosen style consistently?'"

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Plagiarism is about deception—concealing where information came from to claim it as your own.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 24 emphasizes that plagiarism is not about minor oversights in citation style (A) but about 'concealing external sources.' It defines plagiarism as the 'unauthorized use or claim of authorship.' The core of the offense is misleading the reader about the origin of the work, which is a serious breach of honesty and trust."

        {
          "id": 12,

            "A": "Whether the breach was discovered by a peer reviewer or an editor.",
            "B": "The seniority of the researcher who committed the breach.",
            "C": "The impact of the breach on the final research findings.",
            "D": "The action being deliberate or grossly negligent, rather than an honest error."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Misconduct requires intent or gross negligence; honest mistakes are not considered misconduct.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 19 clarifies this crucial distinction: 'Not all breaches = misconduct → Only deliberate or grossly negligent actions count.' This means that an honest error, made in good faith, is treated differently from an action where the researcher intentionally cheated or was recklessly careless about following the rules. This element of intent or severe negligence is the key factor in classifying an action as misconduct."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Self-plagiarism is reusing your own previously published work without acknowledgement, presenting it as new.",
          "long_explanation": "This scenario describes self-plagiarism, which is addressed under 'Original Work' in TUM-SGwP §11 (Slide 22). Academic publishing requires that publications present new and original results. Reusing one's own prior work without proper citation is deceptive because it presents old work as if it were new. While it could be related to fragmentation (D), the core act of reusing one's own text is self-plagiarism."

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Paraphrasing is best for integrating ideas into your own narrative flow, while quoting is for preserving specific wording.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 39 explains that paraphrasing is useful 'When integrating a source into the flow of your writing.' Direct quoting is better when the exact wording is crucial, such as in legal texts or definitions (B). Option A describes a reason to quote, not paraphrase. Option D is incorrect because paraphrased ideas always require a citation."

          "short_explanation": "Innovation is a goal of research, but not one of the six core ethical values of academic integrity.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 4 presents the six fundamental values from the International Center for Academic Integrity: Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage. While innovation is a highly valued outcome of academic work, it is not considered one of the foundational ethical values that govern the process itself."

          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The Ombudsperson's initial role is to seek a technical, discipline-specific resolution before escalating.",
          "long_explanation": "As shown in the flowchart on Slide 27, the 'Initial Review by Ombudsperson' stage has a 'Focus on technical resolution.' The goal is to see if the issue can be resolved within the academic field (e.g., through clarification, correction, or mediation) before it needs to be escalated to formal legal or statutory bodies. The Ombudsperson is a neutral mediator, not a legal representative (C) or a punisher (A)."

          "short_explanation": "Idea plagiarism is taking someone's core concept or idea, even in your own words, without giving credit.",
          "long_explanation": "This scenario perfectly fits the definition of 'Idea plagiarism / obfuscation' from Slide 25: 'Presenting another author's ideas in your own words without citing the source.' Even though the words are different, the intellectual property—the theory itself—belongs to Dr. Smith, and failing to credit him is a serious form of plagiarism."

This is a key legal and ethical distinction. It means that simple, honest mistakes are not misconduct. However, you don't have to prove malicious intent (C); being recklessly careless (grossly negligent) is enough to constitute misconduct."

The right to citation is granted so that you can engage with the cited work (e.g., critique it, support your argument with it). If there is no such connection and the quote is just 'for show,' the primary condition of purpose is not met, making the citation illegitimate even if it is formatted correctly."

When translating, the goal must be to preserve the original meaning as faithfully as possible. Altering the meaning to fit a narrative is a form of misrepresentation and violates the conditions of Zitatrecht.
