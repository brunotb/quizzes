          "question": "According to the principles of Design Thinking, a team develops a revolutionary AI product that is technically sound and financially sustainable, but fails in the market because users find it confusing and unnecessary. Which core pillar was most neglected?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Feasibility",
            "B": "Viability",
            "C": "Desirability",
            "D": "Integrability"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Desirability is about whether people actually want or need the product; this was the key failure.",
          "long_explanation": "The three pillars of Design Thinking are Desirability (human need), Feasibility (technical possibility), and Viability (economic sustainability). The product was feasible and viable, but it failed the desirability test. Design Thinking emphasizes starting with the human need (Desirability) before investing heavily in the other two areas."

          "question": "The Double Diamond model is structured around alternating phases of divergent and convergent thinking. What is the primary goal of the very first phase, 'Discover'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "To narrow down the problem to a single, manageable statement.",
            "B": "To brainstorm a wide range of potential solutions for the problem.",
            "C": "To build and test initial prototypes with a core user group.",
            "D": "To explore the problem space broadly without premature judgment."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The 'Discover' phase is divergent, meaning its purpose is to explore and gather insights about the problem space widely.",
          "long_explanation": "The 'Discover' phase is the first divergent stage, focused on understanding the problem space, not defining it. Its goal is to gather as much information and as many perspectives as possible through research and observation. Narrowing down the problem happens in the next convergent phase, 'Define'. Brainstorming solutions occurs in the second diamond ('Develop')."

            "A": "It has a clear stopping point once the optimal solution is found.",
            "B": "Solutions can be definitively proven as true or false through testing.",

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Wicked problems are unique, complex, and often symptoms of deeper, interconnected problems.",
          "long_explanation": "According to the ten properties of wicked problems, they have no definitive formulation, no stopping rule, and solutions are 'good or bad' not 'true or false'. They are also essentially unique, and every wicked problem can be considered a symptom of another problem. The other options describe characteristics of 'tame' or simple problems."

          "options": {
            "A": "By prioritizing pure scientific research over practical application.",
            "B": "By defining technology as the 'art of experimental thinking'.",
            "C": "By establishing a strict hierarchy with Science primary and Art secondary.",
            "D": "By separating the arts of production from the process of science."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Dewey saw technology not as hardware, but as the process of experimental thinking, which is central to Design Thinking.",
          "long_explanation": "Dewey's pragmatism shifted the focus from a neo-positivist view (Science first) to a more integrated perspective where technology is the art of experimental thinking (Science as Art â†’ Technology). This aligns with Design Thinking's emphasis on prototyping, testing, and learning through doing, rather than relying solely on abstract theory."

          "options": {
            "A": "To create a fully functional, market-ready version of the solution.",
            "B": "To learn quickly and inexpensively by making ideas tangible.",
            "C": "To finalize the visual design and branding of the product.",
            "D": "To document all user requirements before development begins."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Prototyping is about building to think and learning fast; it's not about creating a finished product.",
          "long_explanation": "The 'Prototype' stage is about creating low-fidelity, inexpensive representations of ideas (e.g., sketches, mockups) to test assumptions and gather user feedback. The goal is to learn and iterate, not to build a polished, final product. This 'fail fast, fail cheap' mentality is core to the non-linear, iterative nature of the process."

            "D": "Test"
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The solution's success came from deeply understanding the users' cultural context and practical needs, which is the goal of the Empathize stage.",
          "long_explanation": "While all stages were important, the core innovation of Khushi Baby came from the deep empathy the team developed for the caregivers and health workers. Understanding their cultural customs (the black thread necklace), their environment (lack of connectivity), and their needs led directly to a solution that was not just functional but also desirable and appropriate."

            "A": "Design Thinking is for physical products, while Agile is for software.",
            "B": "Design Thinking is collaborative, while Agile is an individual process.",
            "C": "Design Thinking is linear, while Agile is iterative and cyclical.",
            "D": "Design Thinking explores the problem; Agile executes the solution."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Design Thinking is about 'finding the right problem,' whereas Agile is about 'building the solution right.'",
          "long_explanation": "This is a key distinction. Design Thinking is used in the 'fuzzy front end' of a project to explore, define, and validate the problem and a potential solution concept. Agile is a development methodology used after a solution is defined to build, deliver, and iterate on it efficiently. They are complementary, not competing, processes."

          "options": {
            "A": "Symbols (Communication)",
            "B": "Objects (Construction)",

            "D": "Systems (Thought)"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Designing a process or a service journey falls under the third order: Interactions and Actions.",
          "long_explanation": "Buchanan's four orders are Symbols (e.g., logos), Objects (e.g., a product), Interactions (e.g., user experience, services), and Systems (e.g., organizational structure). A customer onboarding journey is a sequence of actions and services, placing it squarely in the third order of Interactions."

          "question": "The 'truck stuck under a bridge' puzzle is used to illustrate a core skill in Design Thinking. What is this skill?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Root-cause analysis",
            "B": "Stakeholder mapping",

            "D": "Prototyping solutions"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The elegant solution (letting air out of the tires) comes from reframing the problem from 'truck is too tall' to 'truck is too high off the ground'.",
          "long_explanation": "The puzzle highlights the power of reframing. Instead of accepting the initial problem definition ('the truck is too tall for the bridge'), a designer challenges assumptions. By reframing it as a relationship between the truck, its tires, and the road, a simple, non-obvious solution appears. This is a fundamental skill for innovation."

          "options": {
            "A": "A focus on aesthetics to a focus on pure function.",
            "B": "An individual craft to a collaborative scientific process.",
            "C": "A specialized trade activity to an integrative discipline.",
            "D": "An intuitive art form to a data-driven engineering practice."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Design has grown from a specific trade to a broad, integrative discipline that complements arts and sciences.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 3 explicitly traces the evolution of design from a 'trade activity' to a 'segmented profession' and finally to a 'new liberal art' and an 'integrative discipline'. This shift is a response to the need to solve complex problems by breaking down knowledge silos, which is the core premise of modern Design Thinking."

          "id": 11,
          "question": "The failure of Amazon's AI hiring tool was not just a technical glitch. A Design Thinking perspective reveals it was primarily a failure to:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Use a sufficiently large training dataset for the algorithm.",
            "B": "Recognize the problem as a socio-technical issue with historical biases.",
            "C": "Implement the latest machine learning models for text analysis.",
            "D": "Automate the entire hiring pipeline to remove human error."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The core failure was viewing the problem as purely technical, ignoring the embedded social and historical biases.",
          "long_explanation": "The case study on slides 30-33 emphasizes that viewing the problem as a simple technical challenge ('speeding up resume screening') was the initial mistake. A deeper reflection, characteristic of Design Thinking, revealed it as a socio-technical issue rooted in historical biases. The AI didn't create bias; it replicated and amplified existing societal bias present in the data."

          "id": 12,
          "question": "In the detailed Double Diamond diagram (slide 23), which of the following methods is listed as a 'convergent' activity used in the 'Define' phase?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Brainstorming",
            "B": "Root-cause analysis",

            "D": "Rapid prototyping"
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Root-cause analysis is a convergent activity used to narrow down and define the core problem.",
          "long_explanation": "The 'Define' phase is about convergenceâ€”making sense of the data gathered in 'Discover' and narrowing it down to a clear problem statement. Root-cause analysis (like the 5 Whys) is a classic convergent technique for digging deeper to find the fundamental issue. Brainstorming, field research, and prototyping are all divergent activities associated with other phases."

          "id": 13,
          "question": "Don Norman's 'Coffeepot for Masochists' is a classic example of poor design because it lacks discoverability and understanding. What does 'discoverability' mean in this context?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The user's ability to find the product for sale in a store.",
            "B": "The possibility of figuring out what actions are possible with the object.",
            "C": "The ease with which the object's materials can be identified.",
            "D": "The product's potential to reveal new, unintended uses over time."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Discoverability is about whether it's obvious what you can do with an object just by looking at it.",
          "long_explanation": "In Norman's principles, discoverability refers to the user's ability to perceive the possible actions an object affords. For a door, a handle suggests pulling; for a button, its shape suggests pushing. The masochistic coffeepot fails this, as the handle is on the same side as the spout, making its intended action (pouring) unclear and dangerous."

          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Creative Inquiry is the facet that describes Design Thinking as a structured process of asking and answering questions.",
          "long_explanation": "The slide maps out four facets. 'Spirit or Culture' is about the organization-wide mindset. 'Imaginative Act' is about seeing new possibilities. 'Cognitive Processes' are the mental mechanics. 'Creative Inquiry' specifically frames Design Thinking as a systematic, disciplined art of investigation through questioning, which perfectly matches the description."

          "options": {
            "A": "Because some stages can be skipped to save time and resources.",
            "B": "To allow teams to flexibly revisit stages as new insights emerge.",
            "C": "Because the stages have no logical connection to one another.",

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Non-linearity allows for iteration; for example, a test can lead back to redefining the problem.",
          "long_explanation": "The non-linear nature is the key to iteration and learning. A finding during the 'Test' phase might reveal a fundamental misunderstanding of the user's need, forcing the team to go back to the 'Empathize' or 'Define' stage. It's a responsive cycle, not a rigid waterfall process where you can't go back."

            "A": "The lack of legal recourse for users who agree to unfair terms.",
            "B": "The technical difficulty of storing large terms of service documents.",
            "C": "The use of overly simplistic language in legal agreements.",
            "D": "Information overload and a deliberate lack of transparency."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The project uses design to make complex, opaque legal documents understandable at a glance, tackling information overload.",
          "long_explanation": "Standard Terms of Service are a classic design failure. They are intentionally long, dense, and full of jargon, which causes information overload and prevents meaningful consent. The ToS;DR project applies design principles (visual hierarchy, summaries, grades) to make this information transparent and digestible for the user."

          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "This reflects the 'one-shot operation' property, where every attempt has significant, often unforeseen, consequences.",
          "long_explanation": "This scenario perfectly illustrates the 'one-shot operation' property (every attempt counts significantly). Unlike in a lab, you can't test a social policy without real-world consequences. The implementation itself creates new conditions and problems. While it's also related to being a symptom of another problem, the direct cause-and-effect of the intervention highlights the high stakes of each attempt."

          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Interactions are about processes and services; Systems are about the larger context like organizations or ideologies.",
          "long_explanation": "The third order, Interactions, deals with designing flows, services, and user experiences (the 'how'). The fourth order, Systems, is a step higher in abstraction. It deals with designing the underlying environment, organization, or ideology that shapes those interactions (the 'why' and 'where'). For example, designing a hospital's check-in process is third-order; designing the hospital's entire culture of patient care is fourth-order."

          "long_explanation": "The 'Idea Curve' illustrates the non-linear nature of creativity. It argues against the tendency to converge too early ('the tough get stupid'). To achieve breakthrough innovation, teams must engage in divergent thinking long enough to explore ideas that may initially seem boring or absurd, as these often serve as stepping stones to brilliant insights."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Categories are rigid boxes; placements are flexible lenses that allow for innovation and reframing.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 11 contrasts these two terms. Categories have 'fixed meanings and boundaries' and are associated with a linear view of design professions. Placements, however, have 'flexible boundaries' and provide a 'context for thinking', allowing for novel approaches and innovation. The lecture emphasizes that in modern design, placements are primary and categories are secondary."

          "short_explanation": "This model shows that the design process doesn't happen in a vacuum; it needs a supportive culture and leadership.",
          "long_explanation": "By placing Engagement (connecting with stakeholders) and Leadership (creating the right conditions) around the Double Diamond, the model illustrates that the process itself is not enough. For Design Thinking to thrive and lead to real innovation, it must be embedded in a supportive organizational context that values collaboration, experimentation, and culture change."

          "long_explanation": "This example (slide 17) illustrates that design is not just about function but also about shaping interactions. By choosing to leave a notification instead of making the message vanish silently, the design introduces social elements like curiosity, suspicion, or transparency into the conversation, directly impacting the emotional and social context for users."
