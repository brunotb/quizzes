          "question": "A researcher is exploring the emerging field of 'AI-driven art generation' and wants to map the key concepts, themes, and types of evidence available without assessing the quality of each study. Which type of literature review is most suitable for this objective?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Systematic Review",
            "B": "Meta-Analysis",
            "C": "Scoping Review",
            "D": "Hermeneutic Review"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "A Scoping Review is used to map the terrain of an emerging field, identifying concepts and evidence without a deep quality assessment.",
          "long_explanation": "The key purpose described is 'mapping' an emerging field to understand its breadth, which is the primary goal of a Scoping Review. A Systematic Review would answer a specific question and assess quality. A Meta-Analysis requires quantitative data to combine statistically. A Hermeneutic Review would focus on deep, interpretive understanding of concepts, not just mapping the types of evidence."

          "id": 2,
          "question": "According to the lecture, the process of moving from a tentative topic to a refined research problem is described as an 'iterative process'. What is the primary driver of this iterative cycle?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The availability of funding for the research topic.",
            "B": "The researcher's personal interest in the subject.",

            "D": "The insights and gaps discovered during the literature review."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The literature review is the engine of the iterative process, helping you refine your ideas based on existing knowledge.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 3 illustrates that the literature review is the central step that allows a researcher to reframe their initial question. It's the critical engagement with existing work that transforms a vague idea into a focused, researchable problem by identifying a specific gap. While personal interest initiates the process, the literature review drives its refinement."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "A Practical-Knowledge Gap is a conflict between what is known (theory/research) and what is done (practice).",
          "long_explanation": "This type of gap, also called an 'action-knowledge conflict,' arises when the behavior of practitioners in the field differs from what research or theory suggests is optimal. Option A is an Evidence Gap. Option C is a Methodological Gap. Option D is a Population Gap."

          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The 'Seminal Study' approach structures the review around one foundational piece of research.",
          "long_explanation": "As described on Slide 31, the Seminal Study approach is most useful when one study is clearly central to the field. It uses that study as an anchor to organize and discuss all related literature. This differs from a Chronological approach, which follows time, or a Topical approach, which is organized by themes."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The thesis statement of a literature review is its central argument about the state of the field.",
          "long_explanation": "As per Slide 27, a literature review's thesis statement offers an argument about the literature itself (e.g., pointing out a gap, critiquing a trend). It is not the thesis of the entire dissertation, but rather the controlling idea for the review chapter, guiding the reader on the point you are proving about the existing research."

          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Synthesizing information to create something new is the highest cognitive objective in a literature review.",
          "long_explanation": "The taxonomy, based on Bloom's, places 'Synthesize' at the highest level. This involves creating a new whole by arranging and combining pieces from various sources, such as proposing a new framework. Describing is 'Summarize' (lowest level), Assessing is 'Evaluate' (high level), and Applying is 'Analyze' (mid-level)."

          "id": 7,
          "question": "A researcher finds that all existing studies on the usability of a new AI software were conducted on university students. She decides to conduct her research on elderly users. What type of research gap is she primarily addressing?",

          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "A Population Gap exists when research has not been conducted on a specific, relevant population.",
          "long_explanation": "As defined on Slide 42, a Population Gap relates to a population that is under-researched or not represented in the existing evidence base. Since the prior research is limited to one demographic (students), extending it to another (elderly users) directly addresses this gap."

            "D": "Presenting the information in a compelling, story-like format."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Systematic reviews are defined by their rigorous, explicit, and reproducible methodology to minimize bias.",
          "long_explanation": "While a narrative review tells a story and can be useful for context, its main weakness is the potential for bias because the author's method for selecting sources isn't explicit. A systematic review's core strength is its transparent, pre-specified, and rigorous methodology, which aims to find all relevant evidence and minimize bias."

            "A": "To identify gaps and trends in existing research.",
            "B": "To synthesize findings and contribute to theory building.",
            "C": "To provide a definitive and final answer to the research question.",
            "D": "To enhance the rigor and credibility of the researcher's own study."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "A literature review justifies and informs new research; it doesn't provide the final answer itself.",
          "long_explanation": "A literature review serves to understand the current state of knowledge, find gaps, and build a foundation for new research. The new research (the researcher's own study) is what attempts to answer the research question. The literature review frames the question but does not answer it definitively."

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The matrix is a tool for synthesis, helping you analyze and find patterns across multiple sources.",
          "long_explanation": "The matrix is used in Step 4: Evaluating and Synthesizing. By systematically extracting key information (methods, findings, weaknesses) from each source into a table, the researcher can easily compare them side-by-side. This facilitates the identification of themes, debates, and gaps, which is the core of synthesis."

          "options": {
            "A": "You should only cite papers that agree with your own hypothesis.",
            "B": "You must read and summarize every single paper related to your topic.",
            "C": "You should prioritize a deep analysis of the most relevant papers over a shallow review of all papers.",
            "D": "You must select papers based on the prestige of the journal they were published in."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Being strategic means focusing your analytical energy on the most important papers for your topic.",
          "long_explanation": "As stated on Slide 38, it is not feasible to cover every paper in depth. Being strategic means identifying the seminal and most directly relevant works and analyzing them thoroughly, while perhaps only briefly mentioning less central studies. This ensures the review has depth and focus rather than being a superficial list."

            "D": "Narrative Review"
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "A Meta-Analysis is the specific method used to statistically combine results from multiple quantitative studies.",
          "long_explanation": "While a Meta-Analysis is a type of systematic review, the key action here is 'statistically combines the results'. This defines it as a Meta-Analysis. A Systematic Review could summarize the findings without statistical combination, and Scoping or Narrative reviews would be inappropriate for this specific quantitative goal."

        {
          "id": 13,
          "question": "When evaluating a source's trustworthiness, the lecture suggests asking, 'Is the source current?'. Why is this question particularly important in a field like 'AI in Society'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Because older theories are always incorrect and should be discarded.",
            "B": "Because the field is rapidly evolving, and older findings may be outdated by new technology.",
            "C": "Because journals have a policy of only accepting articles published in the last two years.",
            "D": "Because seminal, foundational studies are less important than recent ones."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "In fast-moving fields like AI, currency is crucial as technology and its societal impact change quickly.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture advises balancing seminal works with current research. In a field like AI, technological advancements can happen so fast that research from even five years ago might not reflect the current state of technology or its implications. Therefore, assessing currency is vital to ensure the review is relevant to the present context."

          "options": {
            "A": "A group of researchers who meet to discuss and interpret texts together.",
            "B": "The process of searching through a circular list of predefined keywords.",

            "D": "A software tool that graphically maps connections between different authors."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The hermeneutic circle is the continuous, circular process of interpreting between the parts and the whole.",
          "long_explanation": "As mentioned on Slide 17, the hermeneutic circle is the core philosophical process of this review type. It describes the idea that one's understanding of a single text (a part) is shaped by their understanding of the broader context (the whole), and the understanding of the whole is continually refined by analyzing its individual parts. This creates a continuous, interpretive loop."

          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "An Empirical Gap exists when a theory or concept has not been tested with real-world data.",
          "long_explanation": "An Empirical Gap (or Evaluation Void Gap, Slide 42) addresses a topic that has been discussed theoretically but lacks empirical evaluation. The question in option D directly proposes to test a theoretical framework with empirical, real-world data, thus filling that specific type of gap. Option A addresses an Evidence Gap. Option B addresses a Knowledge Gap. Option C addresses a Theoretical Gap."

          "options": {
            "A": "By only including studies that have been published in the last year.",
            "B": "By basing the review on facts from research and avoiding personal opinions or emotional language.",

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Objectivity is maintained by focusing on evidence and analysis, not personal feelings or biased presentation.",
          "long_explanation": "Slide 37 advises maintaining an objective tone by basing the review on facts from existing research. This means critically analyzing and presenting the findings, including strengths and weaknesses, without letting one's own un-argued opinions or emotional language color the review. It requires a balanced and evidence-based approach."

          "short_explanation": "The conclusion summarizes, explains the implications ('so what'), and explicitly links the review to your own research.",
          "long_explanation": "According to Slide 32, the conclusion is not just a summary. Its critical functions are to explain the significance of the findings (the 'so what'), state the implications for future research (highlighting the gap), and make a clear connection to the researcher's own study, thereby justifying it."

          "long_explanation": "As emphasized on Slides 24 and 34, synthesis is the opposite of a disconnected list of summaries. It involves higher-order thinking to connect ideas from various sources, thereby creating a coherent argument about the state of the field, identifying trends, and revealing gaps that aren't visible from a single paper."

          "long_explanation": "Slide 15 explicitly states that a scoping review 'does not typically assess quality of included studies' and is 'often precursor to systematic review'. Its goal is breadth (mapping a field), while a systematic review's goal is depth (answering a specific question with high-quality evidence). The other options are incorrect generalizations."

This involves engaging with complex and conflicting evidence rather than just presenting studies that support one viewpoint. It demonstrates a researcher's ability to handle nuance and shows intellectual honesty, which strengthens the credibility of the review."
