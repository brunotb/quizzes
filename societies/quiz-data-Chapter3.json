          "question": "According to the lecture, when visions of AI's future are primarily based on 'perceptions' rather than 'empirical studies', who tends to benefit most from the resulting policies and developments?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The general public through increased transparency",
            "B": "Independent academic researchers",
            "C": "Government regulatory bodies",
            "D": "Tech companies and powerful stakeholders"
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Perceptions can be swayed by those with vested interests, benefiting powerful actors.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture highlights that when social imaginaries about AI are based more on perceptions and hype, rather than rigorous empirical grounding, the resulting policies often align with the interests of powerful stakeholders, such as tech companies, who can influence these perceptions to their advantage. This contrasts with the idea of public benefit or academic neutrality."

          "question": "Beyond just concerns about privacy, what does Shoshana Zuboff argue is the fundamental human right threatened by surveillance capitalism?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The right to economic equality",
            "B": "The right to individual sovereignty and self-determination",
            "C": "The right to technological employment",
            "D": "The right to government oversight"
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Zuboff emphasizes the erosion of our ability to control our own lives and choices.",
          "long_explanation": "Zuboff's core argument is that surveillance capitalism is not merely a privacy issue, but a deeper threat to human autonomy. She defines individual sovereignty as 'the right to determine one's future and the right of sanctuary,' arguing that the constant prediction and nudging of behavior undermines our fundamental capacity for self-determination."

          "id": 3,
          "question": "When Cathy O'Neil refers to AI models as 'opaque' or 'black boxes,' what is the primary issue she is highlighting?",

            "A": "They are deliberately kept secret from the public for commercial gain.",
            "B": "Their internal decision-making processes are difficult to understand, even for experts.",
            "C": "They are designed to conceal the original data sources they were trained on.",
            "D": "They can only process data from unverified or 'dark' sources."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The 'black box' problem is about the lack of transparency in how complex AI models arrive at their conclusions.",
          "long_explanation": "Cathy O'Neil emphasizes that the complexity of many AI models, particularly deep learning systems, makes their internal logic and decision-making processes incomprehensible even to the mathematicians and computer scientists who build them. This opacity makes it challenging to identify, understand, and correct biases or errors, thus concentrating power in the hands of a few who operate these systems."

            "A": "By strictly adhering to principles of open-source software and free information for all.",
            "B": "By encouraging users to contribute unpaid 'digital labor' and data that platforms then monetize.",
            "C": "By decentralizing control over digital infrastructure to a wide community of developers.",
            "D": "By establishing democratic governance structures for all digital platforms."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The original open and sharing ethos is re-purposed for profit through user-generated data and content.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture explains that the original 'hacker ethics' emphasized collaboration and free information. However, platform capitalism co-opts this by encouraging users to contribute content, data, and even perform micro-tasks (referred to as 'digital labor') for free or very low pay, which platforms then use as a valuable resource to generate profit. This transforms a collaborative ethos into a mechanism for value extraction."

          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "GenAI creates new things, unlike older AI that mainly analyzed or predicted.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture defines Generative AI by its ability to *generate* new content, such as text (ChatGPT), images (DALL-E), or audio, rather than just analyzing existing data or performing predictive analytics. This creative capacity is what distinguishes it from previous AI systems and opens up new possibilities and challenges."

            "C": "It emphasizes public discourse and participation but actively excludes experts from decision-making.",
            "D": "It prioritizes social well-being and equality over economic growth and technological advancement."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "The neoliberal ideal of open innovation clashes with the reality of power consolidating in a few hands.",
          "long_explanation": "The 'neoliberal imaginary' suggests that an unregulated environment will inevitably foster innovation and solve problems. However, the lecture argues that evidence points to the contrary, showing that this approach has led to a centralization of power and resources in the hands of a few tech giants, rather than broad, distributed innovation and benefit for all."

            "D": "Global financial derivatives"
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Data has become the modern economy's new 'raw material' for growth.",
          "long_explanation": "Srnicek's core argument in 'Platform Capitalism' is that as traditional manufacturing became less profitable, capitalism shifted its focus. Data, harvested from digital interactions, became the crucial new resource that platforms extract, analyze, and monetize to drive economic growth and vitality in the modern economy."

            "D": "A rogue mutation of capitalism"
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "It's 'parasitic' because it feeds on and manipulates behavior, rather than just exchanging goods.",
          "long_explanation": "Zuboff describes surveillance capitalism as having a 'parasitic economic logic' because the production of goods and services becomes secondary to the primary goal: extracting data for the purpose of predicting and influencing human behavior. The platforms' business model is deeply intertwined with this behavioral modification."

        {
          "id": 9,
          "question": "In Cathy O'Neil's analysis, which specific area of impact highlights how algorithmic bias can lead to the disproportionate targeting of certain communities for increased scrutiny and policing?",

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Predictive policing and sentencing algorithms can perpetuate biases in the justice system.",
          "long_explanation": "Cathy O'Neil's work, particularly in the realm of 'Justice,' discusses how algorithms can embed and amplify biases. For example, predictive policing algorithms, when trained on historically biased crime data, can lead to increased surveillance and arrests in certain communities, thus perpetuating existing inequalities and disproportionately targeting specific groups."

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Anticipatory thinking is about proactive shaping of the future, not just reacting.",
          "long_explanation": "Anticipatory thinking involves proactively imagining potential futures related to AI and then designing policies and interventions in the present to steer development towards desirable outcomes or mitigate undesirable ones. It's about foresight and deliberate shaping, rather than merely waiting for problems to arise or predicting without action."

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Platform capitalism often redefines employment to avoid traditional labor obligations.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture highlights that platform capitalism, particularly through the rise of the gig economy, often reclassifies workers as independent contractors. This allows companies to avoid providing traditional labor protections, benefits, and minimum wage requirements that come with full-time employment, leading to increased precarity for workers."

          "id": 12,
          "question": "A key concern raised about Generative AI is 'deskilling.' What does this concept primarily refer to?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The gradual decrease in AI's performance capabilities over time.",
            "B": "The potential for humans to lose fundamental cognitive or practical skills due to over-reliance on AI.",
            "C": "The displacement of highly skilled human jobs by advanced AI systems.",
            "D": "The reduced technical expertise required to operate Generative AI tools."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Deskilling is about humans losing skills, not AI becoming less capable.",
          "long_explanation": "Deskilling, in the context of Generative AI, refers to the worry that as AI automates more complex tasks (like writing or summarizing), humans may become overly dependent on these tools and consequently lose their own abilities to perform those tasks or engage in critical thinking, leading to a homogenization of knowledge work."

            "A": "It's a direct government takeover of major tech corporations.",
            "B": "It's a subtle, often unnoticed, power grab that erodes human rights and sovereignty without explicit consent.",
            "C": "It refers to a rebellion by tech elites against traditional economic and political systems.",
            "D": "It describes the hierarchical management structure within large tech companies."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "It's a silent overthrow of individual control, not a visible revolution.",
          "long_explanation": "Zuboff characterizes surveillance capitalism as a 'coup from above' to emphasize that it's not a visible, violent revolution, but a gradual and often hidden appropriation of human experience and rights. This 'power grab' occurs subtly through the pervasive collection and monetization of data, undermining individual sovereignty without overt public awareness or consent."

            "A": "Algorithms are intentionally programmed with discriminatory biases against specific socioeconomic groups.",
            "B": "They are trained on historical data that reflects existing societal inequalities and prejudices.",
            "C": "Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds lack access to advanced AI tools for self-improvement.",
            "D": "The core design principle of algorithms prioritizes efficiency over fairness in all decision-making."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Algorithms learn and perpetuate biases embedded in historical data.",
          "long_explanation": "O'Neil argues that algorithms are not inherently discriminatory but become so because they are trained on vast datasets that reflect existing human prejudices, historical discrimination, and societal inequalities. By learning from this biased data, algorithms then replicate and even amplify these biases when making decisions about individuals, disproportionately harming vulnerable populations."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Policies based on perception can be less evidence-based and more influenced by opinion or power.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture points out that relying on 'perceptions' for AI policy can lead to outcomes where decisions are driven by popular sentiment, hype, or the influence of specific groups, rather than by a rigorous, evidence-based understanding of AI's actual societal impacts. This can result in policies that serve particular interests or perpetuate misconceptions."

          "long_explanation": "When knowledge generated by AI is described as 'performative,' it means that its primary value lies in its utility and effectiveness in performing specific tasks or producing desired outputs, rather than in providing deep understanding, causal explanations, or transparent reasoning. This can lead to an illusion of 'unlimited knowledge' that may lack genuine insight or be difficult to verify."

          "long_explanation": "The neoliberal ideal posits that deregulation will lead to open competition and widespread innovation. However, the lecture argues that in the context of AI, the lack of regulation has instead resulted in the centralization of power and resources, with a few dominant tech giants cornering the market, thereby contradicting the promise of broad innovation and open competition."

This occurs because AI systems, by standardizing knowledge work and personalizing content, can limit exposure to varied perspectives and encourage conformity, leading to a more uniform and less diverse intellectual and cultural landscape."

          "long_explanation": "Zuboff argues that a core aim of surveillance capitalism is to achieve 'total certainty' by predicting and, crucially, *controlling* human behavior. By accumulating vast amounts of behavioral data, platforms seek to reduce the unpredictability of human action, allowing them to nudge and modify behavior for commercial or other strategic purposes, thereby eliminating uncertainty."

          "long_explanation": "O'Neil's statement underscores the lack of transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision-making. Because AI models are often 'black boxes,' individuals affected by their decisions (e.g., denied a loan, flagged for policing) find it nearly impossible to understand the reasoning behind the verdict or to effectively appeal it, leading to a sense of powerlessness and injustice."

Instead, they receive indirect benefits such as convenience, access to services, or participation in online communities.

This is frequently followed by a period of disillusionment when the technology fails to meet these unrealistic expectations, creating a predictable cycle of excitement and letdown."

It refers to the unprecedented capacity, enabled by surveillance capitalism, to know, predict, and ultimately influence human behavior on a mass scale. This power allows for new forms of social control and presents unique challenges to individual autonomy and democratic societies."
