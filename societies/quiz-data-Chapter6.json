          "question": "Which of the following best describes 'in-practice opacity' in AI systems?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The deliberate concealment of algorithms by private corporations.",
            "B": "A fundamental inability to understand how complex AI models function internally.",
            "C": "The practical difficulty of tracing and understanding data processing and AI output generation, even when information is theoretically available.",
            "D": "The lack of transparency due to insufficient documentation of AI development processes."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "In-practice opacity is a practical, not fundamental, barrier to understanding due to complexity.",
          "long_explanation": "In-practice opacity refers to the overwhelming scale and complexity of modern data ecosystems and AI pipelines, making it practically impossible for individuals to trace the full history of data and its transformations, even if all steps were theoretically documented. This differs from 'in-principle opacity' (B), which suggests a fundamental unknowability of the AI's internal logic, or simple lack of documentation (D)."

          "question": "According to the chapter, why is 'reproducibility' considered not a universal solution for ensuring AI output reliability?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It inherently leads to the commodification of research outputs, hindering transparency.",
            "B": "Its meaning varies significantly across different scientific fields, making a single standard difficult to apply.",
            "C": "It is a concept primarily relevant only to highly controlled laboratory experiments, not real-world AI applications.",
            "D": "It guarantees the absence of bias, but not the relevance or ethical implications of the AI output."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Reproducibility's meaning changes per field, preventing a universal standard.",
          "long_explanation": "The chapter highlights that reproducibility means different things in different contexts (e.g., computational vs. wet lab). This variability makes it challenging to apply a single, consistent standard across all AI applications, thus limiting its effectiveness as a universal solution for reliability. It does not inherently lead to commodification (A), nor is it only relevant to labs (C), and it does not guarantee the absence of bias (D)."

          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The object-oriented view assumes universal online access inherently brings improvement and equity.",
          "long_explanation": "The 'object-oriented view' of Open Science simplifies openness to mean making digital research outputs (data, papers, code) universally accessible online. It assumes that this act alone inherently leads to improved scientific quality, global reach, and equity, without fully accounting for the complexities of understanding, misuse, or the need for human context and engagement. This contrasts with more nuanced views (A) and does not align with IP protection (C) or strict control (D)."

          "options": {
            "A": "Because it simplifies the data collection process, making it more efficient for AI training.",
            "B": "Because diverse perspectives contribute to a richer, more robust understanding of what 'quality' means for the AI system.",
            "C": "Because it guarantees immediate universal access to AI outputs, fostering broader adoption.",

          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Hyperspecialization creates language barriers, making understanding difficult.",
          "long_explanation": "Hyperspecialization leads to researchers developing highly specific jargon and methodologies within their narrow fields. This creates communication barriers, making it challenging for those outside a particular specialization, including the general public, to comprehend the research, thus contributing to 'in-practice opacity' and eroding public trust. While it might indirectly affect collaboration (C) or method preference (D), its direct contribution to opacity is through intelligibility."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Judicious connection prioritizes strategic human interaction and context over unrestricted access.",
          "long_explanation": "Judicious connection moves beyond the 'object-oriented' view of simply making everything available. It emphasizes that connections should be 'situated and responsive to context,' fostering trust and collaboration through thoughtful human interactions rather than advocating for unlimited, immediate access (A) or purely automated linkages (C). It explicitly values quality and context over mere speed (D)."

          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Open Science has a long history, so its 'novelty' is a misleading narrative.",
          "long_explanation": "The chapter argues that Open Science is not a new invention but has 'long been a constitutive value for scientific research,' operationalized in various ways over centuries. Therefore, presenting it as a 'novelty' can obscure its historical roots and the diverse forms it has taken, suggesting it's merely a recent trend or technological fad, rather than an enduring principle."

          "short_explanation": "Epistemic justice values all forms of knowledge.",
          "long_explanation": "Epistemic justice, as discussed in the context of 'judicious connection,' means ensuring that different forms of knowledge, ways of knowing, and perspectives (particularly from marginalized communities) are recognized and valued. This broadens the scope of inquiry and helps to identify biases or blind spots that might arise from a narrow viewpoint, making the overall research more robust and reliable. It is not about funding distribution (A), method prioritization (B), or universal standards (D)."

Build in methods to identify and value expert knowledge.' This is because human experts bring unique nuanced judgments, tacit knowledge, and practical skills that AI cannot replicate. Disregarding this human element would lead to less reliable and less context-aware AI systems, as AI should augment, not replace, human intelligence."
