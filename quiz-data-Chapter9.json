          "question": "What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes 'epistemic harms' from other types of harm, such such as physical or financial harm?",
          "options": {
            "A": "They damage a person's or group's capacity to know, be understood, or contribute to knowledge.",
            "B": "They always involve deliberate malice or intent to cause damage.",
            "C": "They solely affect individuals, not groups or communities.",
            "D": "They are primarily concerned with the theft of tangible intellectual property."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Epistemic harms are about damage to one's knowing capacity.",
          "long_explanation": "Epistemic harms are ethical or knowledge-based injuries that specifically compromise an individual's or group's ability to produce, access, or share knowledge. Unlike physical or financial harms, they target the realm of 'knowing' rather than bodily integrity or material wealth. While they can have physical or financial consequences, their primary nature is epistemic."

          "id": 2,
          "question": "According to Miranda Fricker, what is the core mechanism of testimonial injustice?",
          "options": {
            "A": "The deliberate withholding of information from a speaker.",
            "B": "The unfair discounting of a speaker's credibility due to prejudice.",
            "C": "The absence of shared concepts to understand an experience.",
            "D": "The exploitation of intellectual labor without proper compensation."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Testimonial injustice is about biased credibility judgments.",
          "long_explanation": "Fricker defines testimonial injustice as occurring when a speaker's credibility is considered deficient by a hearer in virtue of identity prejudice held by the hearer. This leads to their testimony being unfairly dismissed or given less weight, regardless of its truthfulness."

          "id": 3,
          "question": "A research team consistently overlooks valuable insights from junior members because their internal communication tools are outdated and difficult to use. According to Kristie Dotson's framework, what 'order' of exclusion does this best represent?",

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Inefficient tools cause First-Order Exclusion.",
          "long_explanation": "Dotson's First-Order Exclusions refer to inefficient practices or poor execution within existing systems that lead to knowledge being overlooked. These are often fixable with straightforward solutions like better training, clearer guidelines, or improved tools, distinguishing them from deeper structural issues."

            "D": "A pharmaceutical company patenting a traditional medicinal plant compound without acknowledging or compensating the Indigenous community from which the knowledge originated."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Extractivism is taking knowledge as a commodity without fair return.",
          "long_explanation": "Epistemic extractivism, as per Alcoff, treats knowledge as a commodity, stripping it from its context and ignoring the epistemic agency of the originating community. Patenting traditional knowledge for profit without acknowledgment or benefit-sharing directly exemplifies this, as the knowledge is extracted for its exchange-value without respecting its original use-value or community ownership."

          "id": 5,
          "question": "In the 'Curare Case,' Goldstein argues that the patients' suffering constituted a 'warranted epistemic harm' (epistemic disadvantage) in part because:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Patients lacked the specialized medical knowledge to understand the drug's properties, making their exclusion from medical decision-making 'justified' in that specific context.",
            "B": "Physicians deliberately intended to cause pain to the patients.",
            "C": "The concept of 'pain' was entirely absent from the medical discourse of the 1940s.",
            "D": "The patients' testimony was dismissed solely due to identity prejudice against children, with no other contributing factors."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Warranted harm implies justified exclusion due to expertise differences.",
          "long_explanation": "Goldstein's concept of 'warranted epistemic harm' or 'epistemic disadvantage' applies when harm results from warranted asymmetrical relations that justifiably exclude individuals from hermeneutical participation. In the Curare case, while testimonial injustice (due to prejudice against children) was present, the 'warranted' aspect came from the patients' non-expert status regarding the drug's pharmacological properties, combined with the non-deliberate scientific misunderstanding by the physicians at the time. The exclusion from technical understanding was 'justified' by their lack of medical expertise."

          "question": "A large tech company initiates a 'community partnership' to collect data from a low-income neighborhood for an AI project. The community provides significant time and local knowledge, but the company retains full ownership of the data and all future profits, offering the community only token gestures. This scenario best illustrates:",

          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Inclusion without fair return is exploitative.",
          "long_explanation": "Pohlhaus's 'exploitative inclusion' describes systems that include marginalized knowers but exploit them through non-reciprocal extraction of epistemic labor. The community is 'included' in the data collection, but the benefits flow predominantly to the company, demonstrating a problematic form of inclusion where power dynamics remain skewed and the community's intellectual labor is exploited without equitable return."

          "id": 7,

          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Distorted public narratives lead to imposed ignorance.",
          "long_explanation": "Kidd and Carel (and Spencer) identify 'imposed ignorance' as a form of epistemic harm where public distortions of medical conditions prevent individuals from self-recognizing symptoms or developing self-agency. This differs from diagnostic nondisclosure (withholding information) and testimonial injustice (credibility deficit)."

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Financial exploitation is a *consequence*, not a *type* of epistemic harm.",
          "long_explanation": "While financial exploitation can be a *consequence* of epistemic harms (e.g., unacknowledged exploitation of intellectual labor leading to financial loss for the original knower), it is not itself listed as a *type* or *manifestation* of epistemic harm. The manifestations are directly about how knowledge is treated, valued, or acquired, not the ultimate economic outcome."

          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "A lack of shared concepts to understand experience is hermeneutical injustice.",
          "long_explanation": "Fricker's hermeneutical injustice occurs when a person or group is marginalized from the collective processes of meaning-making, leading to a global lack of conceptual resources to understand their experiences. The sexual harassment example perfectly illustrates this, as the concept itself was missing from wider public discourse, making it difficult for individuals to articulate their experiences as a shared systemic problem."

          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Ableist norms create a narrow 'normal' that misinterprets diversity.",
          "long_explanation": "As discussed by Peña-Guzmán & Reynol, ableist norms define a narrow 'normal' for bodies and responses. This can lead to medical assumptions that skew understanding, causing misunderstanding and mis-treatment of patients whose experiences (e.g., pain, anxiety levels) fall outside this idealized standard, leading to their valid experiences being misinterpreted or dismissed."

          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Unjust harms are wrongful and prejudice-driven.",
          "long_explanation": "Goldstein's 'unjust epistemic harms' are synonymous with Fricker's epistemic injustices. They are defined by their wrongful nature, stemming directly from identity-based prejudice and deliberate or systemic biases that unjustly disadvantage individuals or groups in their capacity as knowers."

          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Fundamental design flaws requiring paradigm shifts are Third-Order Exclusions.",
          "long_explanation": "Kristie Dotson's Third-Order Exclusions refer to systemic design flaws where the very structure or foundational principles of a knowledge-producing system inherently marginalize certain forms of knowledge. These are the most profound and difficult to fix, requiring a 'paradigm shift' to re-evaluate and restructure the system's core tenets."

          "long_explanation": "Gardiner's 'error-pattern harms' include the 'crying wolf' trope, where legitimate and repeated warnings or complaints from marginalized groups are dismissed as exaggerations or false alarms, leading to their genuine concerns being ignored. This is a specific extension of testimonial injustice where the *pattern* of dismissal is the harm."

          "long_explanation": "As highlighted by Alcalay & VandeKerckhove, lower-resourced partners in the MIDEQ project deliberately restricted data sharing as a strategy to protect their knowledge. Their core anxieties revolved around data control, ensuring proper attribution, and maintaining the contextual integrity of their information, given historical patterns of exploitative knowledge extraction."

          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Failing an exam from lack of study isn't an epistemic harm.",
          "long_explanation": "Epistemic harms are ethical/knowledge-based injuries tied to how knowledge is produced, accessed, or shared, often involving issues of credibility, exclusion, or exploitation. A student failing due to insufficient study time is a personal academic outcome, not a systemic or ethical harm related to the integrity or distribution of knowledge itself."

          "short_explanation": "Withholding information 'for their good' is diagnostic nondisclosure.",
          "long_explanation": "Kidd and Carel identify diagnostic nondisclosure as the practice of withholding information from patients, often under the guise of acting 'for the patient's good,' which isolates them from understanding and participating in their own care. This differs from imposed ignorance, which is about broader public distortions."

          "long_explanation": "As discussed by Peña-Guzmán & Reynol, ableist norms define 'normal' bodies and metrics. If an AI is trained on such narrow data, it will perpetuate these skewed assumptions, leading to misunderstanding and mis-treatment of diverse patients whose bodies or responses do not fit the 'norm.' This directly reflects the perpetuation of ableist harms through AI."

The exclusion of traditional knowledge is not rooted in identity prejudice, but in a genuine conceptual gap (lack of framework to integrate different knowledge systems) and a justified asymmetry of expertise (policymakers lacking specific traditional knowledge).

          "long_explanation": "Epistemic harms are broadly defined as ethical or knowledge-based injuries that affect how knowledge is created, made available, or exchanged. While they can sometimes involve intentional acts (like censorship) or resemble intellectual property theft, their definition is broader, encompassing systemic issues, unintentional consequences, and damage to the very capacity to know or be known, not just physical destruction or legal theft."

          "long_explanation": "Fricker identifies 'restricted development of epistemic capacities' as a harm where individuals or groups are prevented from fully developing their cognitive abilities related to knowing, understanding, and contributing to knowledge. This goes beyond simply not being believed (undermining credibility) or having evidence questioned (doubt cast), focusing on the long-term impact on their potential as knowers."

          "long_explanation": "Third-Order Exclusions, as per Dotson, represent the deepest level of structural epistemic oppression, where the very design or foundational principles of a system are flawed. Consequently, addressing them requires a 'paradigm shift'—a complete re-evaluation and restructuring of the system's core assumptions and design, rather than superficial fixes."

This decontextualization fundamentally distorts the knowledge, making it a mere raw material, and leads to injustice by devaluing its original meaning and the complex relationships that gave it significance."

          "long_explanation": "This term refers to a complex scenario where lower-resourced partners, acting with justified caution to protect their knowledge from potential misuse or exploitation in unequal collaborations, choose to restrict data sharing. While this protects them from direct unjust harms, it simultaneously creates a 'disadvantage' for the broader collective knowledge, leading to a less complete understanding in the larger research community."

In contrast, epistemic disadvantage (warranted harm) is characterized by non-deliberate harms, speakers lacking conceptual precision, and justified exclusion from expertise, making option A the key differentiator that does *not* apply to warranted harm."
