          "question": "According to Michael Jordan's distinction in the panel discussion, the current reality of AI development is best understood as:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Intelligence augmentation, where systems amplify human capabilities to solve large-scale problems.",
            "B": "Standalone replacement, where the primary goal is to create conscious, human-like entities.",
            "C": "A focus on Large Language Models exclusively, making all other forms of AI obsolete.",
            "D": "Mainly a theoretical exercise with limited real-world application beyond academic research."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Michael Jordan emphasizes that real-world AI is about augmenting (or amplifying) human intelligence, not replacing it with a standalone consciousness.",
          "long_explanation": "In the required reading, Michael Jordan draws a sharp contrast between the sci-fi dream of a 'standalone replacement' AI and the engineering reality of 'intelligence augmentation.' Current AI, from logistics optimization to LLMs, functions as a powerful tool that enhances human problem-solving on a massive scale. The other options are incorrect because the 'standalone replacement' is the hyped-up vision, not the reality (B); LLMs are the current stage but not the exclusive focus (C); and AI has widespread, profound real-world applications (D)."

          "question": "The concept of a 'stack of inequality' suggests that the challenge of global AI inclusion is:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Primarily a software problem that can be solved with better algorithms.",
            "B": "A layered infrastructural problem, where lack of electricity prevents internet access, which in turn prevents AI access.",
            "C": "Mainly a cultural issue related to the unwillingness of some societies to adopt new technologies.",
            "D": "An economic problem that will be automatically solved as technology becomes cheaper over time."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "The 'stack of inequality' refers to the foundational layers of infrastructure (electricity, then internet) needed before AI is even possible.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture illustrates this concept with three maps: electricity access, internet penetration, and internet in schools. It shows that AI disparity isn't a single problem but a cumulative one. Without the most basic layer (electricity), the next layer (internet) is inaccessible, and without the internet, the final layer (AI) is out of reach. This systemic, layered challenge cannot be solved by software alone (A), is not primarily a cultural choice (C), and shows no signs of solving itself automatically without targeted intervention (D)."

          "id": 3,
          "question": "Why is creating a universally 'fair' and 'unbiased' AI system a fundamentally sociological challenge, according to the lecture?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Because current algorithms are not yet advanced enough to process the complexities of human ethics.",
            "B": "Because programmers and data scientists lack the necessary training in ethics and sociology.",
            "C": "Because human societies have conflicting, context-dependent values, and AI cannot resolve these disagreements but will instead reflect the values of its creators.",
            "D": "Because there is not enough diverse data available to train a truly unbiased model."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "AI can't magically solve human disagreements about fairness; it can only reflect the values embedded into it by its designers.",
          "long_explanation": "The core issue is that 'fairness' and 'bias' are not objective, universal concepts. As the lecture explains using the example of university admissions, different communities have different, often conflicting, ideas about what is fair. An AI system cannot act as a neutral arbiter of these human value conflicts. It will inevitably be designed with a specific set of values, thus reflecting a particular worldview. While better algorithms (A), more training for developers (B), and more data (D) are helpful, they do not solve this fundamental problem of human value pluralism."
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "question": "According to the panel discussion, why is trusting an AI system's output fundamentally different from trusting a human expert's judgment?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Because AI systems are purely logical and free from the emotional biases that affect human experts.",
            "B": "Because human experts can be held legally accountable, whereas AI systems cannot.",
            "C": "Because AI systems are 'black boxes,' and it is impossible to understand their reasoning process.",
            "D": "Because human trust is often a collective process of managing uncertainty, a capability current AI systems lack."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "Humans build trust together by communicating doubt and collaborating, but AI can only mimic confidence without truly managing uncertainty.",
          "long_explanation": "Michael Jordan's point in the reading is crucial here. Humans don't just trust individuals in isolation; they build 'collective trust' by navigating uncertainty together. A human expert can say, 'I'm not sure, let's look at this further,' expressing genuine doubt. An AI might say 'I'm very sure,' not because it has reasoned about its confidence, but because that phrase appeared in its training data. This inability to genuinely participate in the collective, social process of managing uncertainty is a key difference. While accountability (B) and the 'black box' problem (C) are relevant issues, the concept of collective trust (D) captures a deeper, more fundamental distinction discussed by the panel."
        },
        {
          "id": 5,
          "question": "The 'technological imperative,' as discussed in the context of AI development, is the tendency to:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Prioritize what is technically optimal or easiest for the system, rather than what is most beneficial for the people it affects.",
            "B": "Mandate that all new technologies must be regulated by government bodies before they are released.",
            "C": "Believe that technology will inevitably solve all of humanity's most pressing problems, such as poverty and climate change.",
            "D": "Insist that technology must always be open-source and freely accessible to everyone."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "The technological imperative is the bias of making choices that fit the tech, not the people, often leading to culturally insensitive outcomes.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture explains this concept using Sabina Leonelli's example from the reading about AI in agriculture. An AI might prioritize easily quantifiable genetic data over complex, qualitative local knowledge because it's a better 'fit' for the algorithm. This is a classic case of the technological imperative: the needs and logic of the technology dictate the solution, rather than the nuanced needs of the human users. This is distinct from a general belief in technology's power to solve problems (C) or specific policies on regulation (B) or open-source access (D)."
        },
        {
          "id": 6,
          "question": "Which of the following scenarios best illustrates Michael Jordan's concern about the 'loss of the user-producer relationship' in the age of AI?",
          "options": {
            "A": "An artist uses an AI image generator to create new works, speeding up their creative process.",
            "B": "A tech company scrapes millions of public domain artworks and blog posts to train a proprietary AI model, which it then sells as a commercial service.",
            "C": "A group of musicians collaborates online using AI-powered software to create a new album.",
            "D": "A company develops an open-source AI tool and releases it for free for anyone to use and modify."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "This refers to when value created by the public (producers) is captured by a company to build a product, breaking the connection and compensation.",
          "long_explanation": "The core of this concern, exemplified by Wikipedia in the reading, is about uncompensated value extraction. In scenario B, the original creators of the art and text (the 'producers') have their work used to create a commercial product without their involvement, consent, or compensation. The direct link and sense of shared creation are lost. In contrast, scenario A shows augmentation, C shows collaboration, and D represents an open model that preserves a different kind of user-producer relationship. Scenario B is the clearest example of the one-way, extractive model that Jordan criticizes."

          "id": 7,
          "question": "The use of AI to generate thousands of 'fake' public comments on proposed government regulations is a powerful example of how AI can:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Improve democratic participation by giving a voice to underrepresented groups.",
            "B": "Ensure that all regulations are based on purely objective, data-driven evidence.",
            "C": "Be used to muddle public discourse and make it difficult to distinguish genuine public opinion from automated campaigns.",
            "D": "Streamline the regulatory process, making governments more efficient and responsive."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "This practice, mentioned as a form of resistance or disruption, uses AI to 'muddle the waters,' making it hard to identify authentic public voices.",
          "long_explanation": "This example, discussed in the panel reading, highlights a dark side of AI's capability. Instead of clarifying public opinion, it can be weaponized to create a fog of 'astroturfing' (fake grassroots support), drowning out genuine citizen voices and making the democratic process harder to navigate for regulators. It does the opposite of improving participation (A), ensuring objectivity (B), or streamlining the process in a positive way (D)."

          "id": 8,
          "question": "How might AI, despite its potential to provide personalized education, actually risk exacerbating the global educational divide?",
          "options": {
            "A": "By being too difficult for teachers in the Global South to learn how to use effectively.",
            "B": "Because AI tutors are often designed with cultural biases that make them unsuitable for non-Western students.",
            "C": "By creating a dependency on technology that weakens traditional teaching methods.",
            "D": "Because access to AI educational tools requires reliable internet and electricity, which are lacking in many schools in the Global South."
          },
          "answer": "D",
          "short_explanation": "The educational benefits of AI are irrelevant if schools lack the foundational infrastructure (internet, electricity) to access them.",
          "long_explanation": "This question directly tests the understanding of the 'stack of inequality' as it applies to education. While teacher training (A), cultural bias (B), and dependency (C) are all valid concerns, the most fundamental barrier discussed in the lecture is infrastructural. The promise of tools like Khanmigo, mentioned by Martha Minow, cannot be realized if a school lacks the electricity and connectivity to use them. This means that AI could accelerate learning for already-advantaged students, thereby widening the existing educational gap."
        },
        {
          "id": 9,
          "question": "The emphasis on 'co-design' and 'involvement' from panelists like Martha Minow and Sabina Leonelli suggests that a key principle of responsible AI is that:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Simply providing access to a technology is insufficient; the intended users must be active partners in its creation.",
            "B": "AI systems should be designed exclusively by the communities that will use them, without outside help.",
            "C": "The primary goal of AI design should be to maximize user engagement and daily active use.",
            "D": "All AI development should be paused until a global consensus on ethical principles is reached."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Co-design means moving beyond just giving people access to a tool, and instead making them partners in deciding what the tool should do and how.",
          "long_explanation": "The concept of co-design is a direct challenge to the top-down model of technology development. It argues that true responsibility requires a participatory approach where the end-users are not just passive recipients but active collaborators in the design process. This ensures the technology is aligned with their actual needs, values, and cultural context. It's a more nuanced approach than exclusive design by communities (B), which may lack technical resources, and it prioritizes relevance over simple engagement metrics (C). It is a practical strategy, not a call to halt all development (D)."

          "question": "The evolution of AI from optimizing supply chains to powering personalized recommendation engines represents a significant shift in its use of:",
          "options": {
            "A": "Hardware, from supercomputers to personal devices.",
            "B": "Data, from logistical and numerical data to personal and behavioral data.",
            "C": "Algorithms, from gradient-based systems to rule-based systems.",
            "D": "Purpose, from commercial applications to purely social applications."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "This evolution marks the point where AI began using our personal choices and behaviors, not just impersonal logistical data.",
          "long_explanation": "As outlined in the lecture's summary of the reading, the evolution of AI can be traced through the data it consumes. The first large-scale applications dealt with relatively anonymous, numerical data for logistics. The shift to recommendation engines (like Netflix) marked a pivotal moment where AI started processing our personal, transactional, and behavioral data—what we watch, what we buy, what we like. This made AI's impact much more intimate and raised new questions about privacy and influence. While hardware (A) and purpose (D) also evolved, the fundamental change was in the nature of the data being used."

        {
          "id": 11,
          "question": "The argument that AI responsibility must be considered at a 'planetary scale' primarily emphasizes:",
          "options": {
            "A": "The need for a single, global AI system to manage all world resources.",
            "B": "The fact that AI is being developed by multinational corporations with global reach.",
            "C": "The systemic, global impacts of AI, including its massive energy consumption and its effect on global markets and societies.",
            "D": "The potential for AI to achieve a god-like consciousness that would affect the entire planet."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "'Planetary scale' refers to AI's global, systemic impacts, like its energy footprint and its influence on worldwide economies.",
          "long_explanation": "This concept moves the discussion of responsibility beyond individual actions or single companies. It highlights that the collective development and deployment of AI have massive, systemic consequences for the entire planet. This includes tangible impacts like the enormous energy consumption of data centers, and intangible ones like the restructuring of global labor markets and the spread of information (or misinformation) across borders. It's about the aggregate, worldwide effect, not a single world-managing AI (A), the nature of corporations (B), or sci-fi existential risks (D)."
        },
        {
          "id": 12,
          "question": "According to Martha Minow's argument in the panel, why is legal recourse often an ineffective tool for the average person to resist harmful AI outcomes?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Because laws governing AI are too new and have not yet been tested in court.",
            "B": "Because it is a resource-intensive process that is far more accessible to wealthy individuals and corporations than to ordinary people.",
            "C": "Because judges and lawyers lack the technical expertise to understand how AI systems work.",
            "D": "Because AI systems are owned by international corporations, placing them outside the jurisdiction of national courts."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Minow points out that the legal system is an unequal playing field; litigation requires time and money that most people don't have.",
          "long_explanation": "Martha Minow's point is a sociological one about access to justice. The legal system, in theory, provides a path for recourse. In practice, however, litigation is extremely expensive and time-consuming. This means that large corporations and wealthy individuals can use the legal system far more effectively than a low-income person who has been unfairly denied a loan by an algorithm. The core problem is the inequality of resources, which makes the law an impractical tool for the most vulnerable. While the other options are relevant concerns, Minow's primary argument focuses on the fundamental inaccessibility of the legal process due to resource disparity."

          "id": 13,
          "question": "When an LLM like ChatGPT confidently invents a fake academic source, this phenomenon of 'hallucination' highlights a core problem with:",
          "options": {
            "A": "The system's inability to distinguish between patterns in its training data and verifiable, ground-truth facts.",
            "B": "Deliberate deception programmed into the model by its creators to mislead users.",
            "C": "A lack of sufficient data, as a larger training set would eliminate all inaccuracies.",
            "D": "The algorithm's slow processing speed, which forces it to guess when under pressure."
          },
          "answer": "A",
          "short_explanation": "Hallucinations happen because the AI is a pattern-matching machine, not a fact-checker; it generates what looks like a real source, without knowing if it is one.",
          "long_explanation": "This question gets at the heart of how LLMs work. They are not databases of facts; they are probabilistic models that have learned the statistical patterns of language. A 'hallucination' occurs when the model generates text that is grammatically correct and stylistically plausible (it 'looks' like a real citation) but is factually incorrect. It's not deliberate deception (B), but a byproduct of its core function: pattern replication. More data (C) can reduce but not eliminate this problem, as the data itself may contain contradictions or falsehoods. It is a fundamental issue of how the model works, not its speed (D)."

          "id": 14,
          "question": "The example of an AI for agriculture that prioritizes easily processed genetic data over complex local knowledge about food culture best demonstrates:",
          "options": {
            "A": "The superiority of quantitative data over qualitative knowledge in solving complex problems.",
            "B": "How a tech-centric design approach can lead to culturally inappropriate and exclusionary outcomes.",
            "C": "The inability of AI to process any form of non-textual data, such as farming practices.",
            "D": "A successful application of AI in augmenting the work of traditional farmers."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "This illustrates the 'technological imperative,' where the needs of the algorithm (easy data) are prioritized over the needs of the people, leading to exclusion.",
          "long_explanation": "This example, used by Sabina Leonelli in the reading, is a powerful illustration of the 'technological imperative' and cultural disparity. The choice to exclude local, qualitative knowledge is not made because that knowledge is valueless, but because it is 'messy' and hard to quantify for an algorithm. This prioritizes the convenience of the technology over the needs of the community, resulting in a solution that is a poor fit for its intended context and excludes the expertise of the very people it is supposed to help. It is a clear example of a flawed, exclusionary design process, not a successful one (D)."

          "question": "The term 'ambivalence' in the title of the required reading, 'Amid Advancement, Apprehension, and Ambivalence,' refers to:",
          "options": {
            "A": "A general public apathy and lack of interest in the development of AI.",
            "B": "The technical inability of AI systems to make decisive, unambiguous choices.",
            "C": "The simultaneous feeling of excitement about AI's potential benefits and anxiety about its potential harms.",
            "D": "The disagreement among experts about the precise definition of artificial intelligence."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Ambivalence captures the mixed, often contradictory, feelings of both hope and fear that characterize the current public and expert discourse on AI.",
          "long_explanation": "The title is carefully chosen to reflect the complex emotional and intellectual landscape surrounding AI. 'Advancement' points to the rapid progress. 'Apprehension' points to the fear and risk. 'Ambivalence' is the state of holding both of these feelings at the same time. Many people, including experts on the panel, are deeply ambivalent—they see incredible promise for AI in areas like education and medicine, but are also acutely aware of the risks of inequality, job displacement, and loss of human agency. It describes a psychological and societal state, not public apathy (A) or a technical feature of AI (B)."

          "short_explanation": "Augmentation means the AI is a tool that enhances a human's skill, like a radiologist using AI to improve their diagnostic ability.",
          "long_explanation": "Intelligence augmentation is about AI as a collaborative tool that amplifies human expertise. The diagnostic tool (D) does not replace the radiologist; it empowers them to do their job better. This fits the definition perfectly. The other options lean towards the 'standalone replacement' vision: passing the Turing Test (A) is about mimicking humanity, composing a symphony (B) suggests replacing human creativity, and the robot worker (C) is a direct replacement of human labor."

          "long_explanation": "This question tests the understanding of the layered nature of infrastructural inequality. While cultural resistance (B), cost (C), and language (D) are all potential challenges, the most basic, foundational barrier is electricity. As the world map of electricity access demonstrates, this cannot be taken for granted. Without power to charge the tablets, the entire project is non-viable from the start.

          "options": {
            "A": "Achieving 100% accuracy in all its predictions to eliminate any possibility of error.",

          "long_explanation": "The panelists argue that trust in AI is not about achieving impossible perfection (A) or creating an opaque, secure system (C). Instead, it's a social and procedural issue. A trustworthy system is one where we understand its purpose, the data it was trained on, and its inherent limitations. Crucially, it must operate within a framework of human expertise—where doctors, lawyers, or other professionals can interpret, question, and override the AI's recommendations. A slick interface (D) can create a false sense of security and is the opposite of what is needed for genuine, earned trust."

          "long_explanation": "Michael Jordan's argument about the music market focuses on the economic structure. While platforms like Spotify can seem good for consumers, their payment models and recommendation algorithms can create an environment where a few superstars capture almost all the revenue. This makes it incredibly difficult for emerging or niche artists to earn a sustainable income, even if they have a dedicated following. The long-term risk is a less diverse and vibrant musical culture, as the economic pipeline for new talent is choked off. This is a more nuanced argument than simply replacing musicians with AI (B)."

          "long_explanation": "This is a subtle but important point about power dynamics. Complex regulations like the EU AI Act require significant legal and technical resources to comply with. While these rules are aimed at controlling the power of Big Tech, they can inadvertently create a 'regulatory moat.' Large corporations can afford the lawyers and engineers to ensure compliance, while smaller startups or non-profits cannot.

Bias isn't just a technical glitch to be removed; it's a reflection of societal structures, power dynamics, and historical inequalities. All data generated by humans reflects these realities. The very act of choosing what data to use, what to label as 'fair' or 'unfair,' and what outcomes to optimize for is itself a biased decision, reflecting a particular set of values. Therefore, the goal is not to achieve an impossible 'unbiased' state, but to be transparent about the biases that exist and to make conscious, justifiable choices about which values the system should promote."

A mathematical proof (A) might be too abstract and doesn't account for real-world context. Relying on marketing (C) or individual intuition (D) is unreliable and potentially dangerous. 'Collective trust' means the system is vetted through social mechanisms: peer review (in science), public debate, regulatory oversight, and professional validation. It is the community's shared confidence, built through transparent and participatory processes, that ultimately makes a system trustworthy."

          "long_explanation": "This is another application of the 'conflicting values' problem. If an AI is trained on a company's past hiring data, it will learn to replicate the biases present in that data (e.g., favoring candidates from certain universities or demographics). The challenge is not just cleaning the data, but deciding what 'fairness' means. Does it mean demographic parity? Does it mean rewarding the 'most qualified' based on historical predictors of success (which may themselves be biased)? There is no easy answer, and any choice reflects a specific set of values. This is a deeper problem than data volume (A), security (B), or speed (D)."
