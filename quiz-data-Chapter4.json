          "id": 1,
          "question": "According to Krohs (2012), what is the defining characteristic of 'convenience experimentation' that likens it to 'industrial prefabrication of meals'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "Its primary goal is to generate novel hypotheses through exploratory data analysis.",
            "B": "It simplifies processes and standardizes outcomes, often with theoretical assumptions embedded in the tools.",
            "C": "It significantly reduces the cost of experiments compared to traditional methods.",
            "D": "It requires minimal human oversight due to advanced automation capabilities."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Krohs emphasizes standardization and embedded assumptions, like a pre-made meal.",
          "long_explanation": "Krohs's analogy of 'convenience experimentation' to 'industrial prefabrication of meals' highlights how the tools and procedures themselves simplify the process and produce standardized, predictable outcomes. Crucially, this often means that theoretical assumptions are already 'enshrined' or built into the technology, rather than being openly tested or generated from scratch, similar to how a convenience meal dictates the final dish."

          "question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the three key characteristics of 'convenience' in AI applications, as defined by Mussgnug and Leonelli?",
          "options": {
            "A": "An emphasis on speed and ease of action.",
            "B": "Its inherently objective and universal quality.",
            "C": "A comparative element against alternative approaches.",
            "D": "A subject-dependent and subjective quality."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Convenience is subjective and comparative, not objective or universal.",
          "long_explanation": "Mussgnug and Leonelli define convenience as having three key characteristics: (i) an emphasis on speed and ease of action, (ii) a comparative element (it's convenient *compared to* something else), and (iii) a subject-dependent and subjective quality (what's convenient for one person may not be for another). Therefore, 'inherently objective and universal quality' is explicitly contradicted by their definition."

          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "AI excels at processing vast data and simulating complex scenarios.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture highlights several immediate advantages of AI, including its ability to perform large-scale data analysis and assist in scenario analysis and experimental design. While AI aims to make human input more efficient, it does not claim to eliminate human intuition, guarantee unbiased data (a challenge discussed later), or replace all human researchers."

            "A": "Automatically performing complex surgical procedures without human intervention.",
            "B": "Identifying potential drug candidates from vast chemical libraries.",
            "C": "Anticipating health risks and managing aftercare through data from wearables and 'digital patients'.",
            "D": "Streamlining hospital logistics like patient admissions and supply management."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Predictive prevention uses data to foresee and manage health issues proactively.",
          "long_explanation": "Predictive prevention, as discussed in the health R&D examples, focuses on leveraging data from self-measurement devices (wearables, 'digital patients') to forecast health risks (e.g., Alzheimer's) and manage ongoing care remotely. Options A, B, and D represent other distinct AI applications in health R&D, such as robot-assisted surgery, drug development, and logistics, respectively."

          "id": 5,
          "question": "Why is 'fact-checking' AI outputs considered 'everything but mechanical' in the lecture?",
          "options": {
            "A": "AI models are inherently flawless and do not require external validation.",
            "B": "General fact-checking principles may not apply, and expert human judgment is crucial for context and nuance.",
            "C": "The process is too slow for AI, requiring manual human verification for efficiency.",
            "D": "Fact-checking is a purely creative task that AI is incapable of performing."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Fact-checking AI requires human experts to understand context, not just mechanical rules.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture argues that fact-checking AI outputs is far from mechanical because general principles (like flagging incoherence) may not always be appropriate in complex scientific or social contexts. Instead, it demands extensive and expert human judgment to contextualize information, understand nuances, and assess relevance, which AI cannot fully replicate. This makes it a labor-intensive cognitive task, not a simple automated process."

          "options": {
            "A": "AI algorithms are inherently biased towards processing large amounts of data efficiently.",
            "B": "Well-funded institutions and approaches often set the standards for AI 'excellence,' leading to limited support for low-resource settings.",
            "C": "AI development primarily benefits only high-income individuals and corporations, excluding smaller businesses.",
            "D": "The bias originates from AI models being trained exclusively on data from high-achieving individuals."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "High-resource bias means AI standards are set by the wealthy, neglecting low-resource contexts.",
          "long_explanation": "High-resource bias refers to the phenomenon where AI development and its standards of 'excellence' are predominantly shaped by well-funded institutions and approaches. This often results in AI tools optimized for high-bandwidth settings and specific data types, with insufficient support or consideration for low-resource environments, perpetuating existing inequities and making expensive tech a proxy for quality."

          "options": {
            "A": "AI tools are often too complex for scientists to understand or use effectively.",
            "B": "An AI model can be technically impressive but still produce biased results or encourage narrow research if its assumptions are flawed.",
            "C": "Scientific progress fundamentally relies on human intuition, which AI cannot replicate.",
            "D": "The development of AI for science is excessively slow and inefficient."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Technical excellence in AI doesn't guarantee scientific quality if underlying assumptions are biased.",
          "long_explanation": "The distinction 'good for AI' vs. 'good for science' highlights that while an AI model might be technically sophisticated (e.g., efficient code, powerful algorithms), it doesn't automatically translate to good scientific outcomes. If the AI's underlying assumptions are flawed, its training data is biased, or it encourages a narrow research focus, it can lead to unreliable or incomplete scientific knowledge, despite its technical prowess."

          "id": 8,
          "question": "What is a key challenge related to the promise of 'speed and ease of use' in AI, regarding its long-term reliability?",
          "options": {
            "A": "AI models are inherently stable and do not require any adjustments after deployment.",
            "B": "Automation necessitates frequent, labor-intensive human checks and recalibration to maintain trustworthiness.",
            "C": "The initial setup of AI tools is so complex that it negates any later time savings.",
            "D": "AI's speed makes it impossible for humans to keep up with its outputs, leading to abandonment."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "AI requires continuous human oversight to remain reliable.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture explicitly states that automation, despite its promise of ease, requires 'frequent, labor-intensive (human) checks and recalibration to changing targets / knowledge / context.' Without this ongoing human involvement, AI models can become rigid, perpetuate biases, or produce unreliable results over time, indicating that true 'ease' is often contingent on continuous human effort."

          "id": 9,
          "question": "How does the commercialization of AI tools, particularly regarding Intellectual Property (IP), pose a challenge to 'value compared to other options'?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It encourages robust competition, leading to rapid innovation and superior AI solutions.",
            "B": "It mandates full transparency of algorithms, allowing for easy comparison with alternatives.",
            "C": "It leads to secrecy and a lack of transparency, making fair, like-for-like comparisons impossible.",
            "D": "It ensures that AI tools are always developed with ethical considerations as the top priority."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Commercial secrecy hinders objective comparison of AI tools.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture explains that commercialization and IP protection often lead to secrecy as the default research mode for AI tools. This lack of transparency means that the inner workings (algorithms, training data) are hidden, making it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to conduct fair, 'like-for-like' comparisons with alternative methods or competing AI solutions. This can result in adopting suboptimal tools based on marketing rather than objective assessment."

          "question": "What is a significant limitation of AI models related to 'massive data absences' in fields like health R&D?",
          "options": {
            "A": "AI generates too much data, overwhelming researchers with irrelevant information.",
            "B": "AI can only process visual data, ignoring other sensory inputs crucial for some research areas.",
            "C": "AI struggles with incomplete or biased datasets, particularly lacking non-visual information like taste or sound in research.",
            "D": "AI is unable to synthesize data from different sources, limiting its analytical scope."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "AI is limited by the quality and completeness of its training data, especially non-visual inputs.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture points out that AI models are constrained by 'massive data absences,' particularly beyond visual senses. This means that while AI might excel with visual data, it struggles with or ignores crucial information like taste, sound, or other non-quantifiable inputs, leading to incomplete or biased analyses if the training data is not comprehensive or representative of all relevant sensory modalities."

          "id": 11,
          "question": "What is a key implication of AI's 'lure of convenience' concerning human judgment in scientific practice?",
          "options": {
            "A": "It empowers human judgment by providing all necessary data for decision-making.",
            "B": "It leads to the underestimation of the pertinence of human judgment in contextualizing and giving meaning to information.",
            "C": "It eliminates the need for human judgment by providing definitive, unbiased answers.",
            "D": "It shifts human judgment entirely towards technical aspects of AI development."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Convenience often devalues human judgment in interpreting AI outputs.",
          "long_explanation": "A significant implication highlighted in the lecture is that the 'lure of convenience' in AI applications often leads to the underestimation of the crucial role of human judgment. This judgment is essential for contextualizing AI-generated information (e.g., medical diagnoses for individual patients) and for giving it meaning within complex real-world scenarios, tasks that AI cannot fully perform on its own."

            "D": "Technological superiority and market dominance."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "The framework prioritizes inclusivity and fairness in scientific practice.",
          "long_explanation": "The 'Philosophy of Open Science' framework explicitly positions 'Diversity' and 'Justice' as core, fundamental values guiding how science should be conducted in the age of AI. This contrasts with the narrower focus on convenience, speed, or commercial gain, advocating instead for responsible, inclusive, and equitable scientific practices that consider who benefits and who might be excluded."

          "options": {
            "A": "It invariably leads to a significant increase in scientific breakthroughs.",
            "B": "It often simplifies research processes without compromising evidential foundations.",
            "C": "It can weaken the evidential foundations of science and generate inertia in research planning.",
            "D": "It guarantees the elimination of all human labor in scientific inquiry."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Uncritical adoption can undermine scientific rigor and adaptability.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture warns that the uncritical adoption of Convenience AI, driven solely by the desire to shortcut human labor, can have damaging implications. Specifically, it may 'weaken the evidential foundations of science' and 'generate inertia in how research is planned, set-up and conducted,' leading to potentially compromised knowledge and a lack of critical scrutiny over research processes."

            "A": "It is universally convenient regardless of the user's background.",
            "B": "Its convenience is only meaningful when compared to perceived alternative, less comfortable courses of action.",
            "C": "It adapts its functionality based on the user's geographical location.",
            "D": "It requires extensive contextual data input to function properly."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Convenience is relative; it's convenient compared to something else.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture defines convenience as 'contextual' because it is 'only meaningful given envisaged alternatives.' This means that something is perceived as convenient only in comparison to a more difficult, time-consuming, or less comfortable way of performing the same task. For example, a reference manager is convenient compared to manual citation, not in an absolute sense."

          "options": {
            "A": "It argues that AI can perform both routine and creative tasks equally well, making the distinction irrelevant.",
            "B": "It suggests that many tasks labeled 'routine' actually involve significant expertise and judgment, leading to their devaluation.",
            "C": "It claims that humans should focus solely on routine tasks, leaving creative work to AI.",
            "D": "It states that the distinction is clear-cut and universally agreed upon, posing no challenge."
          },
          "answer": "B",
          "short_explanation": "Many 'routine' tasks require expertise, and their automation can devalue human skill.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture critiques the 'routine' vs. 'creative' distinction by highlighting that many tasks perceived as 'routine' (e.g., data curation, fact-checking) actually require 'extensive and expert (non-automated, case-by-case) judgement.' This common framing risks devaluing essential scientific labor and overlooking the cultivated skill and practical knowledge involved, rather than genuinely freeing up researchers for more creative contributions."

            "A": "It limits AI's reach to only former colonial territories, hindering global adoption.",
            "B": "It ensures diverse representation in datasets, leading to more equitable AI outcomes.",
            "C": "It contributes to skewed data representation and differential treatment in data governance and analysis, perpetuating biases.",
            "D": "It primarily affects historical data, having no bearing on contemporary AI models."
          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "Historical biases lead to skewed data and unfair treatment in AI.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture explicitly states that 'colonial heritage and discrimination' contribute to 'skewed representation' in datasets and 'differential treatment in data governance and analysis.' This means that AI models trained on such historically biased data can perpetuate and even amplify existing social injustices, leading to unfair or inaccurate outcomes for marginalized groups, thereby making inequity worse rather than better."

          "options": {
            "A": "Top-down AI is always superior and makes bottom-up efforts redundant.",
            "B": "Context-specific AI is too slow and expensive to be practical for most research.",
            "C": "The lure of general-purpose AI may lead to adopting solutions that don't perfectly fit nuanced, specific research needs.",

          },
          "answer": "C",
          "short_explanation": "General-purpose AI, while convenient, may not be suitable for nuanced problems.",
          "long_explanation": "The lecture highlights a tension where the push for 'top-down, general-purpose AI' (often built by powerful entities) can lead to solutions that are convenient but may not be 'best adapted to their prospective applications within science and medicine.' This risks overlooking the need for 'bottom-up, context-specific' AI tailored to nuanced problems, as the 'lure of convenience' often favors readily available, generalized tools even when they don't perfectly fit the specific research question."

          "long_explanation": "One of the three defining goals of Convenience AI is its 'value compared to other options.' The lecture explains that proponents of these AI solutions explicitly discuss and critique 'previous or alternative approaches' by portraying them as boring, slow, labor-intensive, or inconvenient, thereby positioning the AI solution as a superior and easier choice.

          "short_explanation": "Convenience is personal; it varies based on who is using the tool.",
          "long_explanation": "The 'subjective quality' of convenience means that it is 'subject-dependent and subjective.' What one person considers convenient (e.g., a fast AI tool) depends heavily on their individual capabilities, skills, and their personal perception of the task's difficulty or enjoyability. This contrasts with an objective or universal measure, emphasizing that convenience is perceived rather than inherent, and is influenced by the user's background."

          "long_explanation": "The overarching conclusion is that 'Convenience AI does not necessarily deliver on its promises.' This is because its perceived ease and speed often mask significant hidden labor (maintenance, interpretation), its comparative value is skewed by commercial interests and lack of transparency, and it tends to underestimate the crucial role of human judgment and diverse background knowledge. These factors mean it can lead to suboptimal solutions, weakened evidential foundations, and the perpetuation of biases, rather than a universally improved scientific practice."
